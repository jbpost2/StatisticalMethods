### R Reading Data

When it comes to reading in data, where do we start?  Our plan for this section is as follows:

- Look at common raw data formats  

- Take a few quick asides: R projects, `factors`, and R packages

- Read 'clean' delimited data

- Read Excel, SAS, & SPSS data  

- Resources for JSON data, XML data, databases, and APIs


**How to read in data depends on raw/external data type!**  

We'll start by focusing on delimited data.  

- Delimiter - Character (such as a `,`) that separates data entries

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/delimitedData.png")
``` 

To read in data we'll need functions to do so.  When you open R a few `packages` are loaded.  

```{r , fig.align = 'center', out.width = "250px", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("img/loadR.png")
```

R Packages:  

- Collection of functions/datasets/etc. in one place  

- Packages exist to do almost anything 

- [List of CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) approved packages on R's website  

- Plenty of other packages on places like GitHub  

The `utils` package that automatically loads has *family* of `read.` functions ready for use!  Reading data with these functions is often referred to as reading with a standard R or base R method.
 
Function and purpose:

Type of Delimeter           | Function   
--------------------------- | -----------------
Comma                       | `read.csv()`
Semicolon (`,` for decimal) | `read.csv2()`
Tab                         | `read.delim()`
White Space/General         | `read.table(sep = "")`  

Each of these functions requires a **path** to the file in order to read it in. Let's read in the '[neuralgia.csv](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv)' file.  This is a comma separated value file (.csv).  This requires the `read.csv` function.  

R locates the file by the path you give it.  You can give *full path name*.  For example, 
    
* ex: C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods/datasets/neuralgia.csv  
* ex: C:\\\\Users\\\\jbpost2\\\\repos\\\\StatisticalMethods\\\\datasets\\\\neuralgia.csv  

```{r , fig.align = 'center', out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pathVis.png")
```

Notice that a double `\` is needed because `\` is an escape character in R so `\\` is really read as `\`.  

Ok, let's read in the neuralgia csv file using `read.csv`.

```{r , echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
neuralgiaData <- read.csv("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv")
```

```{r , echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
neuralgiaData <- read.csv(
           "C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods/datasets/neuralgia.csv"
           )
```

```{r }
head(neuralgiaData)
```


Pretty simply if the data is nicely formatted!  Using a full local path not recommended though!  Doing so makes it difficult to share code without having to go in and change the paths.  Instead you can change the *working directory* R is using.  That is, the folder by default R is 'looking' for files.  THen we can supply a **relative** path.  As long as other users have the same folder structure as you (say if you are using a github repo), no changes need to be made for them to run the code!

We can determine the working directory using `getwd`.  

```{r }
getwd()
```

This can be changed using `setwd`.

```{r ,eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods/datasets")
#or
setwd("C:\\Users\\jbpost2\\repos\\StatisticalMethods\\datasets")
```

The working directory can also be changed via the menus in RStudio.  

```{r , out.width = "800px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/setwd.png")
```

Another way to supply a path is via a URL.  This is really handy if you have a place to host your datasets!

```{r , eval = TRUE}
neuralgiaData <- read.csv("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv")
```

To recap, to read a csv file you can 

- Use full local path (not recommended)  

- Use relative path  

    + set working directory with `setwd()`  

- Pull from a URL  


#### Quick Aside: RStudio Project

Often we have many files associated with an analysis.  When working on multiple undertakings things get cluttered in R...  With each analysis we may want to associate different  

    + environments  
    + histories  
    + working directories  
    + source documents  

The "Project" feature in R Studio allows us to easily do this!  To create you can use the drop down menus.  

```{r , out.width = "600px",echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/project.png")
```

Now you can easily switch between analyses by using "File --> Open Project" or by using the little drop down menu in the top right of RStudio.  


#### Reading Delimited Data  

- Functions from `read.` family work well  

- Concerns:  

    + A poor default function behavior
    
         * strings are read as `factors`  


## Aside: Factors

```{r strn}
str(neuralgiaData)
```

> - Factor: special class of vector with a `levels` attribute  

> - Levels define all possible values for that variable  
    <ul>
      <li> Great for variable like `Day` (Monday, Tuesday, ...)</li>
      <li> Not great for variable like `Name`</li>  
    </ul>


## Aside: Factors

```{r strn2, error = TRUE}
neuralgiaData$Treatment
neuralgiaData$Treatment[1] <- "M"

#overwrite with another possible level
levels(neuralgiaData$Treatment) <- c(levels(neuralgiaData$Treatment), "M")
levels(neuralgiaData$Treatment)
neuralgiaData$Treatment[1] <- "M"
```


## Aside: Factors

- Useful if you want to order values though (say for plotting!)

```{r reread,echo = FALSE}
neuralgiaData <- read.csv(
      "https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv"
      )
```

```{r factorPlot1,echo=TRUE, eval = TRUE, out.width = '600px', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = neuralgiaData, aes(x = Treatment, y = Duration)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Plot of Duration by Treatment")
```


## Aside: Factors

- Useful if you want to change order of values (say for plotting!)

```{r factorOrder,echo=TRUE, eval = TRUE}
#or use ordered()
neuralgiaData$Treatment <- factor(neuralgiaData$Treatment,
                                  levels(neuralgiaData$Treatment)[c(3, 2, 1)])
neuralgiaData$Treatment
```
<!-- mention ordered vs unordered factors-->


## Aside: Factors

- Useful if you want to change order of values (say for plotting!)

```{r factorPlot2, out.width = '600px', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = neuralgiaData, aes(x = Treatment, y = Duration)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```



## Reading Delimited Data  

- Functions from `read.` family work well  

- Concerns:  

    + A poor default function behavior
    
         * strings are read as `factors`  
         
         * row & column names can be troublesome
    
    + Slow processing  
    
    + (Slightly) different behavior on different computers  
    


## Aside: R Packages

- R package  
    <ul>
      <li> Collection of functions in one place</li>  
      <li> Packages exist to do almost anything</li>  
      <li> [List of CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) approved packages on R's website</li>  
      <li> Plenty of other packages on places like GitHub</li>
    </ul>

<!--Many packages do the same thing.  Some just do it better than others.  Often hard to pick the best one.-->    


## Aside: R Packages

- First time using a package  
    + Must install package (download files)  
    + Can use code or menus 
    
```{r install1, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readr")
#can do multiple packages at once
install.packages(c("readr", "readxl", "haven", "DBI", "httr"))
```


## Aside: R Packages

- First time using a package  
    + Must install package (download files)  
    + Can use code or menus

```{r install2, out.width = "800px",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/packages.png")
```

<!--Can also install them from local sources and stuff like that but that isn't usually required unless you are behind a firewall of some kind that keeps R from accessing the internet.-->
    

## Aside: R Packages

- Only install once!  

- **Each session**: read in package using `library()` or `require()`

```{r libreq1}
library("readr")
require("haven")
```

## Aside: R Packages

- Difference - if no package  
     + `library()` throws an error
     + `require()` returns FALSE

```{r libreq2,error=TRUE,warning=TRUE}
library("notAPackage")
require("notAPackage")
```
<!--require is often used when you write functions that load in packages.  Rather than throwing an error you'd like to just return a warning to the user so they can go and download the package.

Of course, there are ways to load packages by default into your r workspace.  Go to your .Rprofile.site file (usually in C:\Program Files\R\R-***\etc\) and add in options(defaultPackages=c(getOption("defaultPackages"),
       "mypackage1","mypackage2", ... [etc.]))-->


## Aside: R Packages  

- Many packages to do things in R  

> - How to choose?  
     <ul>
       <li> Want 'fast' code</li>  
       <li> Want 'easy' syntax</li>  
       <li> Good default settings on functions</li>  
       <li> Nice set of examples and vignettes</li>  
     </ul> 
     
> - Enter: TidyVerse


## Aside: R Packages  

- Install the `tidyverse` package  

```{r tidy, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```



## Aside: R Packages  

- Install the `tidyverse` package  

```{r tidy2, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

- Load library  

```{r loadTidy, message = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

- Once library loaded, check `help(filter)`  

<!--Note: There are two conflicts.  This just means functions that are named the same thing.  R uses the most recently loaded function and "masks" the old ones.  You can access specific package functions using "::" for instance, stats::filter(...) will call the filter function that has been masked.-->


## Aside: R Packages  

- Can call functions without loading full library with `::`  

```{r readCSVex, eval = TRUE}
readr::read_csv("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv")
```


## Aside: R Packages  

Install packages first (download it)  

 - Can do more than one at a time  
 
Load package with `require()` or `library()`  

 - Call without loading using `::`  
 

## Reading Delimited Data  

We'll use the `tidyverse`!

Function and purpose:

Type of Delimeter           | `utils` Function        | `readr` 
--------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------
Comma                       | `read.csv()`            | `read_csv()`
Semicolon (`,` for decimal) | `read.csv2()`           | `read_csv2()`
Tab                         | `read.delim()`          | `read_tsv()`
General                     | `read.table(sep = "")`  | `read_delim()`
White Space                 | `read.table(sep = "")`  | `read_table()` `read_table2()`


## Reading Delimited Data  

- Let's read in the '[neuralgia.csv](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv)' file  

```{r readCSVex2, eval = TRUE, message = TRUE}
neuralgiaData <- readr::read_csv("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv")
```


## Reading Delimited Data  

- Let's read in the '[neuralgia.csv](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv)' file  

```{r viewData}
neuralgiaData
```


## Reading Delimited Data  

- Notice: fancy printing!  

- Checking column type is a basic data validation step  

- `tidyverse` data frames are called `tibbles`  

```{r class}
class(neuralgiaData)
```


## `tibbles`  

- Behavior slightly different than a standard `data frame`

- No simplification!  

<div class = "columns-2">
```{r simplify}
neuralgiaData[,1]
as.data.frame(neuralgiaData)[,1]

```


## `tibbles`  

- Behavior slightly different than a standard `data frame`

- No simplification!  Use either `pull()` or `$`

```{r pull}
pull(neuralgiaData, 1)
neuralgiaData$Treatment 
```


## Reading Delimited Data  

 - How did R determine the column types?

```{r helpcsv, eval = FALSE}
help(read_csv)
```

> - Other useful inputs:  
<ul>
  <li> `skip = 0`</li>
  <li> `col_names = TRUE`</li>
  <li> `na = c("", "NA") </li>
</ul>
<!--check the help on read_csv again.  See col_types.  Checks first 1000 rows of data and figures out character or numeric.  Notice you can read columns in using specifications.  For instance could specify week as integer and use date or date time when applicable.

**Databases** - Common flow in R  

1. Connect to the database with `DBI::dbConnect()`  
  - Need appropriate R package for database backend  
  
<ol start="2">
<li> Use `tbl()` to reference a table in the database  </li>
</ol>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tbl(con, "name_of_table")
```

**APIs** - Application Programming Interfaces

A defined method for asking for information from a computer  

- Useful for getting data  

- Useful for allowing others to run your model without a GUI (like Shiny)  

> - Many open APIs, just need key  

> - Often just need to construct proper URL


## Resources for Other Data Sources  

**APIs** - Quick Example

- Query Harry Potter database https://www.potterapi.com/

- Get key in top right (sign up for account)

```{r, fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, out.width="800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/HPAPI.png")
```

**APIs** - Quick Example

- Query Harry Potter database https://www.potterapi.com/

- Documentation:  

    + All routes need to be prefixed with https://www.potterapi.com/v1/  
    
    + GET request: /spells returns all spells 
    
    + Key goes on the end  

```{r}
baseURL <- "https://www.potterapi.com/v1/"
value <- "spells?"
key <- "key=$2a$10$UMvDCH.93fa2KOjKbJYkOOPMNzdzQpJ0gMnVEtcHzW5Ic04HUmcsa"
URL <- paste0(baseURL, value, key)
spellData <- RCurl::getURL(URL)
```

**APIs** - Quick Example

- Query Harry Potter database https://www.potterapi.com/

- Default response format is JSON 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
spellData
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
substr(spellData, 1, 100) 
```
