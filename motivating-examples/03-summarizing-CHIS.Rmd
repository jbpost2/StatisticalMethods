## Motivating Example: Summarizing Data - California Health Interview Survey

### Define Objective & Background  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/defineObjective.png")
```  
Look at the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS).  Describe the idea of the survey.  For our purpose we'll imagine the dataset itself is the population of interest.  We will take a sample from that population to investigate and summarize as well as compare to the truth.

### Select Response

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/selectResponse.png")
``` 
Response is really certain variables in the dataset, maybe BMI or some other health related statistic we want to study.

### Determine Sources of Variation

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/determineVariation.png")
```  
Sources of variation include height, weight, ethnicity, etc.  Going to take those into account.

### Select Design

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/selectDesign.png")
```  
Design will be to do a SRS and do an observational study - basically an exploration study.  (Maybe also do an Stratified one and compare the results?  Maybe that should be left as an exercise.)

### Do Study  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/conductStudy.png")
```  
Pretend that we got 100% response rate and all that good stuff.  Maybe discuss the idea of missingness here but probably not the right time.

&nbsp;  

### Do Statistical Analysis  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/statsAnalysis.png")
```  
Main analysis is just to summarize the data set.  As an exercise we will compare the sample to the population since we actually know it here.

### Draw Conclusions & Communicate

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/concludeCommunicate.png")
```  
Describe main results or takeaways to study in the future.  How to present some graphs as well (i.e. don't just put a graph, it must be described and meaningful or don't report it).  Appropriate use of titles and labels too.
