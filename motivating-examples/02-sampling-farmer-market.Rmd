## Motivating Example: Sampling - Farmer's Market   

### Define Objective & Background  

A nutrition scientist wanted to understand the cleanliness and food hygiene of the vendors at the North Carolina State Farmer's Market (henceforth the farmer's market).  Secondarily, she wanted to learn about vendor sales to see if there was a relationship with their cleanliness and food hygiene.  The researcher had access to the names of each vendor's business, their general purpose, and the products they sold.  

The researcher needed to decide the scope of their study.  Formally, they needed to define the **population** of interest.  The population is the group of people or units of interest to the researcher.  As her interest centered around food-related businesses, she restricted to looking at the vendors which sold horticultural crops.  She hoped that conclusions made by her study could apply to all horticulture vendors at the farmer's market - thus, this is her population.  

Note: One could try to do a study at just the North Carolina State Farmer's Market and extend the results to all farmer's markets in the state or in the south, but that would require many assumptions to be valid.  

A [list of the horticultural products sold and their availability](http://www.ncagr.gov/markets/chart.htm) is reproduced below.

### Select Response

The researcher needed to determine the variables to collect that would best help to answer their questions of interest.  These variables that characterize the experiment are called **response** or target variables.  

To investigate the knowledge of hygiene and safety, a short questionnaire was developed to allow the vendor's head manager (or similar employee) to describe their safety protocol and knowledge:  

 - For your produce with signs that say "clean" or "washed", what does this mean?
 - How are the foods transported to the market? eg: refrigerated/closed storage  
 - What food safety risks do you as a vendor worry about?  
 - Do you require one-use gloves to be used?  (Yes or No)  
 - Do you designate a person in charge of money transactions? (Yes or No)  

The researcher also planned to do an assessment of the cleanliness of each vendor's station at different times.  Her team would pick 30 days during the summer in which they'd walk through the vendor stations and collect the following information:  

 - Overall is the station clean (Yes or No)  
 - Is anyone smoking around the food products? (Yes or No)  
 - Are tables covered? (Yes or No)  If so, what is the material?  
 - Do employees appear to be clean? (Yes or No)  
 - Are one-use gloves used? (Yes or No)  
 - Is there a designated person in charge of money transactions (Yes or No)  
 
She noted that there is a yearly cycle to the products sold and decided to collect vendors sales information by looking at the (AMT) amount sold in the last year (in dollars), the (PURCHASE) total number of purchases made in the last year, and the (NUM_ITEMS) total number of items sold in the last year.  For the last variable, they had to decide how to measure the number of items sold for the different types of crops.  For most of the crops looking at the total weight (in lbs) sold made sense.  But, for some, other measures were needed.  For example, for sweet corn the number of ears sold would be recorded.  

You can see that there are many decisions that the researcher must make in simply deciding the response variables to collect!  A poor choice here can make or break a study.

### Determine Sources of Variation

The response variables clearly have some relationship to other variables that could be collected.  For instance, the NUM_ITEMS variable is clearly going to be different based upon what crops the vendor sells.  The AMT variable would differ depending on the size of the vendor's inventory.  These are examples of **explanatory variables** or variables that define the study conditions.  Explanatory variables go by many names such as predictors, features, or independent variables.  

**A main consideration about whether or not to record a variable is whether or not the variable would be related to a variation in a response variable.**  Since the response variables are truly what is of interest, there is really not much of a point in recording variables that likely have no relationship with it.  

Choosing the explanatory variables can also indicate further questions of interest.  For instance, the researcher may want to compare the percent of "Yes" for the overall cleanliness score for vendors that mainly sell vegetables to those that mainly sell fruit leading to a comparison across groups being of interest.  She may want to try to model the AMT of cantaloupe sold as a function of the cleanliness score.  

The average amount for the population or a subpopulation would be referred to as a parameter of interest.  Formally, a **parameter** is a summary measure about a population.  Common parameters investigated include a mean, proportion, median, or variance of different subgroups of the population.  

The explanatory variables she collected about the vendors included the types of crops sold, the services they provide (grow, pack, and/or ship), and whether or not they are a "Got to be NC member".  

For the questionnaire, she added the additional questions below:

  - Are there any organic or synthetic chemicals/fertilizers/pesticides/manures used on the products?  
 -  Are all foods grown/processed by the vendors?    
 - What kind of soil were the products grown in? eg: organic/compost/plant material 

For the assessment of cleanliness, she added the following question:  

 - How many people are working?  
 

**Should we talk about formalizing the other questions they want to answer here??**


### Select Design

For this study the researchers aren't interested in doing an intervention so an observational study was being done.  The major task to consider for the observational study is how to select participants from the population.  The subset of the population we (attempt to) observe our data on is called the **sample**.  The **sample size** is the number of measurements in the sample.

Ideally, we would measure every member of our population.  This is called a **census**.  If a census can be done then the value of a population's parameter can be found exactly by simply summarizing the population data.  However, conducting a census can be extremely costly or time-intensive so most of the time a census cannot be done.  This means that the information we collect would likely be different if we collected it again.  Accounting for this variability is the main reason statistical analysis is needed.  

How the researcher selects their sample is extremely important.  This method is often referred to as the **sampling scheme**.  Using a statistically valid sampling scheme is vital to the assumptions made when doing statistical inference.  A valid sampling scheme implies that every member of the population has a known and non-zero chance of inclusion in the sample.  

There are many good ways to select the sample and many bad ways.  **Need to get more info about the farmer's market to finish this part**
(Talk about bad first and why bad - visuals too)  Talk about good and why good - visuals too.

This idea is further fleshed out at the end of the chapter. (reference/link this)  

Here they chose to do a stratified sample to make sure that they didn't leave out any important subgroups.  

**Should we talk about formalizing the other questions they want to answer here??**

### Do Study  

Go and talk to chosen vendors.  May have some non-response issues.  Ideally a contingency for this should be developed when considering the sampling scheme.  

**Should we talk about formalizing the other questions they want to answer here??**


### Do Statistical Analysis  

**Should we talk about formalizing the other questions they want to answer here??**

The major goals of this study were simply to describe the vendors at the farmer's market.  In this case we can produce numerical and graphical summaries.  

Careful discussion of not selecting a modeling technique based on this unless it is a pilot study or an exploratory study else we have increased our nominal type I error rate... 

Spend a lot of time here talking about graphs of different types.  Sample means, sample variances, etc.

Discuss population curves vs sample histograms and the relationship.

Not a formal test here but comparisons of interest etc.  


### Draw Conclusions & Communicate

What actionable things have we found?  Likely some trends to investigate further.  Perhaps run an experiment to formally see if some alteration can be effective.  

What can we conclude realistically from this data?  To what population are we talking?
