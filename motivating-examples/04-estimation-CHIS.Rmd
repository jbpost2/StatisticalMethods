## Motivating Example: Estimation - California Health Interview Survey

### Define Objective & Background  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/defineObjective.png")
```  
Look at the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS).  Describe the idea of the survey.  For our purpose we'll imagine the dataset itself is the population of interest.  We will take a sample from that population to investigate and summarize as well as compare to the truth.  

Goal of this example is to focus on the summarization of the sample.  We'll be able to compare the summarizations to the actual population since we'll have those items.  

### Select Response

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/selectResponse.png")
``` 
Response is really certain variables in the dataset, maybe BMI or some other health related statistic we want to study.

### Determine Sources of Variation

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/determineVariation.png")
```  
Sources of variation include height, weight, ethnicity, etc.  Going to take those into account.  

don't really get to choose here but the data included has these things.

### Select Design

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/selectDesign.png")
```  
Design will be to do a SRS and do an observational study.  (Maybe also do an Stratified one and compare the results?  Maybe that should be left as an exercise.)

### Do Study  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/conductStudy.png")
```  
Pretend that we got 100% response rate and all that good stuff.  Maybe discuss the idea of missingness here but probably not the right time.

### Do Statistical Analysis  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/statsAnalysis.png")
```  
Main analysis is to estimate parameters.  Discuss parameters and their estimators/estimates.

### Draw Conclusions & Communicate

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '13%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/concludeCommunicate.png")
```
