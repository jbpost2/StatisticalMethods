# Appendix - Learning Objectives {#learningobj}

## Book-level  

After reading this book you will be able to:  

 - illicit relevent sources of variability for a potential study  
 
 - utilize principles of design to plan a reasonable experiment to help answer questions of interest  
   
 - compare and contrast methods for sampling from a population and designing an experiment when the goal of a study is prediction versus when the goal is statistical inference  
 
 - articulate the scope of inferential conclusions in light of the method of data collection, the experimental design used, and the statistical analysis applied  
 
 - choose appropriate numerical summaries and graphical displays for a set of data and create these using software  
 
 - explain the general concept of point estimation and how to account for sampling variability  
 
 - explain the importance of statistical distributions when conducting statistical inference  
 
 - describe the fundamental inferential techniques of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals  
 
 - compare and contrast the use of and interpretations from hypothesis tests and confidence intervals  
 
 - fit statistical models in software and interpret their output  

 - Something about understanding the relationships between the models (linear model framework)  
 
 - Maybe another bit about data types you see, how the assumptions we make impact things
