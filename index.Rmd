# Introduction  

## About the book  

The goal in creating this book is to provide a thorough treatment of applied statistical methodologies geared toward analyzing designed experiments. Our approach emphasizes the problems researchers encounter rather than provide a litany of solutions with only modest context. We discuss a real scientific problem, thoughfully consider the data that could be used to answer that problem, investigate experimental designs that would be useful, and pursue statistical models to make informed decisions in the context of how the data was collected. The focus of the book is on the statistical modeling portion but problems are viewed holistically. We purposefully introduce the linear model framework in matrix form early on and place most of the methodologies under that umbrella. This helps the reader to see the methods as a part of a general framework as opposed to a set of tools within a toolbox. We believe that the book should be appropriate for a graduate level student that has some comfort in mathematics, particularly linear algebra. Both SAS and R are used throughout to make sure the book works for a wide audience of practitioners.


## Software  

At this point software is a requirement for statistics in practice.  There are many available software solutions ranging from point and click to full on programming.  We've decided to focus on R and SAS for this book.  

- R is an open source, platform agnostic, software that is widely used by statisticians.  We'll use the RStudio interactive development environment to write and execute our R code.  

- SAS requires a license but is an extremely powerful software for doing modeling and is used widely enough to merit inclusion here.  For those without a license, SAS University Edition can be installed for free and is also platform agnostic.  We'll use the SAS Studio environment that comes with Univeristy Edition.

As we progress through the book we'll include graphs, descriptive statistics, and analyses from R and/or SAS.  At the end of each chapter a section explaining how to create these in both R and SAS is included.  The following sections give a brief introduction to each software that should prepare you for what's ahead!  

## R  

The general workflow for programming in R involves taking raw data and importing it into R.  Once that data is imported we often create numerical and graphical summaries of the data.  The appropriate model or statistical method is then applied.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/RWorkFlow.png")
```

At the end of this section the reader should be able to do the following:  

- install R and RStudio  
- read and write basic R programs   
- import well formatted data into R
- do basic data manipulation in R   

As the book progresses the steps of summarizing and analyzing the data will be covered.  Let's get started!

```{r, child=c('RBasics.Rmd', 'RReadingData.Rmd', 'RManipulatingData.Rmd')}
```

### SAS

Section designed to demonstrate basic use of SAS via SAS Studio. By the end of this section students will be able to:

    write basic SAS programs in SAS Studio using SAS University edition
    import well formatted data into SAS using the import wizard, PROC IMPORT, or a DATA step
    create common numerical and graphical summaries of data
    understand the capabilities of SAS program (something like this but a little clearer maybe)


SAS Programming Topics

    Common elements of SAS programs: PROC and DATA steps
    Steps, statements, keywords, and options
    SAS windows
    Submitting SAS code, checking logs, and viewing output
    GPP elements

Module 2 - Importing Data Topics

    SAS library
    Data set names (one vs two level)
    Methods for importing data: Instream, Import Wizard, and Data step
    Delimiters and common data formats
    Types of variables in SAS
    Explorer and PROC PRINT/CONTENTS for investigating a SAS data set


Module 3 - Manipulating Data Topics

    very basic stuff
