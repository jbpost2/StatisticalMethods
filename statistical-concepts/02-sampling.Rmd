### Obtaining a Representative Sample  

To get data, we need units for our sample.  We'll discuss a few good and bad ways to obtain units.  

Sampling

Samples must be representative of the population to make valid inference.

**Sampling Scheme** – the method used for selecting members of the population for the sample

Some Sampling Schemes:

- Simple Random Sample
- Stratified Sample
- Convenience Sample (Not good!)
 Many others both good and bad!
 

#### Simple Random Sampling (SRS)  

- Assign each member in the population a number.
- Use a random number mechanism to select which members to use.

Why bother? 

Examples:
- Service Evaluation - disgruntled customers may be more inclined to complete them. \\
- 1936 US presidential election it was incorrectly predicted that Landon would overwhelmingly defeat Roosevelt (source: Literary Digest ).  

    +	Questionnaires were mailed only to people who had both telephones and cars 
    +	Selected sample was not representative of the population.

Remark: SRS does not guarantee a “good” or “representative” sample every time.  

- can get all small values or all large values
-	can get all males or all females

On average we should get a representative sample.  


#### Stratified Sampling  

Divide a population into groups (strata) and select a SRS from each group. 


Example: Academic Support is interested in offering premium movie channels to students that live in dorms.  
This would cause each student’s housing cost to increase by \$250 a semester.  They would like to conduct a survey to gauge support of this change.

How could we use a SRS? Stratified Sample? 

#### Convenience Sample (BAD) 

- Use most convenient group available or decide on the spot.
- Often responses from people who choose to participate.

Bad Sampling Examples?
American Idol, SYTYCD, etc.
ESPN.com polls, News site polls, etc.

How we select our sample is important as we want to avoid biasing our results!
There are a number of different types of data we can collect.
- A good method must have a statistical randomness to them (i.e. must use a random mechanism!)


Sampling is about getting units for your study.  Once done there are two basic types of studies:
**Observational Study** - observe individuals and measure outcomes without influencing the responses.

Ex: measuring political beliefs in using a poll, measuring yield of a crop based on rainfall

Recall **Experimental Study** - deliberately impose a treatment on individuals and observe their response.  

Big difference in conclusions drawn!
- Cannot usually infer causation from observational studies, but you can from a well-designed experiment.
- Experiments are not always feasible or ethical.  i.e. cannot assign people to smoke a pack a day or have expectant mothers drink a certain amount of alcohol.

How to do this important and nuanced.  Next we'll ...
