# StatisticalMethods
Book for use in a methods I &amp; II graduate sequence.


## Mission Statement  

The goal in creating this book is to provide a thorough treatment of applied statistical methodologies geared toward analyzing designed experiments.  Our approach emphasizes the problems researchers encounter rather than provide a litany of solutions with only modest context. We discuss a real scientific problem, thoughfully consider the data that could be used to answer that problem, investigate experimental designs that would be useful, and pursue statistical models to make informed decisions in the context of how the data was collected.  The focus of the book is on the statistical modeling portion but problems are viewed holistically.  We purposefully introduce the linear model framework in matrix form early on and place most of the methodologies under that umbrella.  This helps the reader to see the methods as a part of a general framework as opposed to a set of tools within a toolbox.  We believe that the book should be appropriate for a graduate level student that has some comfort in mathematics, particularly linear algebra.  Both SAS and R are used throughout to make sure the book works for a wide audience of practitioners.  



### META-QUESTION:
How much do we want to use the "treatment means"-type language from ST512? Do we want to use this throughout the text? Do we want to focus on it specifically when we use some examples and otherwise not? 

Justin - I'd like to use it any time we do a designed experiment. Not when we do observational things though.  

## General to do:  

 - Outline/Chapter headings  
     + Look at other books and identify what we like/don't like  
 - Reconsider the name

### Minji to do:  
 - Find data sets that might be reasonable  
     + https://twitter.com/berkouwers/status/1215048826714591232?s=12  
 - Citations for where those were and found/published  
 - Look through books provided and chapters to make a list of tests/methods covered   


### Matt to do:  
 - Find raw data that should be available from IDA stuff
 - Example using Likert-like data to illustrate ordinal data 
 
 
### Justin to do:  
 - Finish writing chapter 2  
 - Outline chapters  
 
 
### Jason to do:  
 - Find data sets from consulting experience that are relevant   
 - Especially any data sets that provide interesting challenges  
 - Look through our mission statement, book outline, chapter structures, and notation section  
 - Things that you've seen in your experience for both stat folks and non-stat folks that we are overlooking
 
 
### Ryan to do:  
 - Nothing for now, just keeping in the loop!
 

Old stuff to keep around:  
- Scope/mission statement  
     + A book that can be used for a graduate level applied methods sequence  
     + Both SAS and R for examples
     + Sections with deeper math/theory available where useful  
     + Matrix stuff throughout, frame where possible through linear model (one sample t, two sample t, etc.)  
- Define Top-Level Learning Objectives  
     + Frame chapters with research questions and how you would think about designing a test/experiment.  Assumptions you'd make and how they lead to a particular analysis.  
     + Perhaps a case-study for each chapter/topic. Data or problem the first thing to think about.  
     + Make book more problem focused than the more traditional theory, math, etc. approach.  Start with the **why**.
