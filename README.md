# StatisticalMethods
Book for use in a methods I &amp; II graduate sequence.


- Scope/mission statement  
     + A book that can be used for a graduate level applied methods sequence  
     + Both SAS and R for examples
     + Sections with deeper math/theory available where useful  
     + Matrix stuff throughout, frame where possible through linear model (one sample t, two sample t, etc.)  
- Define Top-Level Learning Objectives  
     + Frame chapters with research questions and how you would think about designing a test/experiment.  Assumptions you'd make and how they lead to a particular analysis.  
     + Perhaps a case-study for each chapter/topic. Data or problem the first thing to think about.  
     + Make book more problem focused than the more traditional theory, math, etc. approach.  Start with the **why**.  
- Outline/Chapter headings  
     + Look at other books and identify what we like/don't like  
- Learn how Bookdown works
- research how to write a text book
- Reconsider the name


Matt to-do:  
 - get a basic book in bookdown format going in our repo  
 - Rough outline of topics/sequence (if time)   

Justin to-do:  
 - Audience, structure of contents, notation, framing in more detail.  Mission statement essentially.  Talk about problems holistically, etc.  Why are we making this book?  
 - Rough outline of topics/sequence (if time)
