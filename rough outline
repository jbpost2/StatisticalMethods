Chapters (This is harder than I thought!  Seems like doing this without focusing on all the fundamentals to start will just make the first couple inference chapters huge...)

General Chapter Structure
- Motivating Problem/Problem Idea/What Data to Try to Collect
- Explanation of what a good model might be (or maybe this goes in with the data to try and collect?)
- EDA to explore and further motivate new topic
- Background needed for the model/inference
- Culmination of intro example
- Second example to put it all together
- Resources for when shit hits the fan

Alternative:
- Define the objective of the experiment
- Select appropriate response variables
- Identify sources of variation
- Choose experimental design
- Perform the test
- Statistically analyze the data
- Draw conclusions
