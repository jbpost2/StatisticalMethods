Rough outline

#Prologue
Introduction/Foreword/prologue
- Structure of the book
- structure of papers
- math focus/appendix

#Chapter 2 - Sampling, Design, and Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Frame still with question of interest.  Maybe pilot study or study where we mainly care about summary stats.
 - How does data look in the wild and how do we deal with it in the wild.  How could it be modeled via distributions?  Sample representing the larger group.
 - Not too much math here, save that for later mostly.
 - Simulation/Randomization based hypothesis testing.
#Chapter 3 - Point Estimation
 - Bias
 - MLE here a bit for binomial (I think).  Why does it matter to do this estimation in this way?  i.e. for harder problems it won't be so intuitive as sample proportion for estimating the true proportion
#Chapter 4 - Accounting for Uncertainty in Estimation
 - SE stuff
 - Simulation for sampling distributions
 - Some theory
 - Bootstrap? (If we do a parametric bootstrap and did a good job in chapter 2 that might work.  Then do a nonparametric.)
#Chapter 5 - Inference via Hypothesis Testing for a Proportion or Mean
#Chapter 6 - Inference via Confidence Intervals for a Proportion or Mean
#Chapter 7 - Inference on Two Categorical Variables
#Chapter 8 - Inference for Multiple Means
#Chapter 9 - Multiway ANOVA
#Chapter 10 - Block Designs
#Chapter 11 - Regression 
#Chapter 12 - The General Linear Model
#Chapter 13 - Logistic Regression and Generalized Linear Models
#Chapter 14 - Mixed Models
#Chapter 15 - Generalized Linear Mixed Models
#Chapter 16 - Repeated Measures and Split Plot Designs 


Chapters (This is harder than I thought!  Seems like doing this without focusing on all the fundamentals to start will just make the first couple inference chapters huge...)

General Chapter Structure
- Motivating Problem/Problem Idea/What Data to Try to Collect
- Explanation of what a good model might be (or maybe this goes in with the data to try and collect?)
- EDA to explore and further motivate new topic
- Background needed for the model/inference
- Culmination of intro example
- Second example to put it all together
- Resources for when shit hits the fan

Alternative:
- Define the objective of the experiment
- Select appropriate response variables
- Identify sources of variation
- Choose experimental design
- Perform the test
- Statistically analyze the data
- Draw conclusions
