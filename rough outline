Rough outline

Introduction/Foreword/prologue
- Structure of the book
- structure of papers
- math focus/appendix


Chapters (This is harder than I thought!  Seems like doing this without focusing on all the fundamentals to start will just make the first couple inference chapters huge...)
#Point Estimation
- Inference on a proportion  
    + Inference Ideas, Sampling, and Sources of Variability & Experimental Design Fundamentals
    + Data set with a good number of variables
    + Exploratory Data Analysis
    + Discrete RVs & Normal Approximation (CLT)
    + Linear Model Framework
    + Come back to problem in logistic regression setting

General Chapter Structure
- Motivating Problem/Problem Idea/What Data to Try to Collect
- Explanation of what a good model might be (or maybe this goes in with the data to try and collect?)
- EDA to explore and further motivate new topic
- Background needed for the model/inference
- Culmination of intro example
- Second example to put it all together
