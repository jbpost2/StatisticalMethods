Rough outline

Introduction/Foreword/prologue
- Structure of the book
- structure of papers
- math focus/appendix


Chapters (This is harder than I thought!  Seems like doing this without focusing on all the fundamentals to start will just make the first couple inference chapters huge...)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Inference Ideas, Sampling, and Sources of Variability & Experimental Design Fundamentals
- Inference on a Mean 
    + Continuous RVs 
    + CLT
    + Confidence Interval Fundamentals 
    + Hypothesis Testing Fundaments
    + Linear Model Framework
- Inference on a Proportion  
    + Discrete RVs & Normal Approximation
    + Confidence Intervals Fundamentals
    + Hypothesis Testing Fundamentals
    + Linear Model Framework
- Inference on Multiple Means  
    + Multiple Comparison Corrections
- Inference on Two Categorical Variables  
    + Difference of Two Proportions
    + Chi-Square Tests

General Chapter Structure
- Motivating Problem/Problem Idea/What Data to Try to Collect
- EDA to explore and further motivate new topic
- Explanation of what a good model might be (or maybe this goes in with the data to try and collect?)
- Background needed for the model/inference
- Culmination of intro example
- Second example to put it all together
