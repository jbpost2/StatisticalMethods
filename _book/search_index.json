["notation.html", "Chapter 7 Appendix - Notation", " Chapter 7 Appendix - Notation Variables are denoted with Roman letters, such as \\(X\\) and \\(y\\). Lower case letters denote random variables while capital letters denote fixed variables. Note that these vectors may be of length 1 depending on context. Bolded values (\\(X\\)) denote matrices, and in the case of \\(y\\), possibly single-column matrices. Unknown parameters are denoted with Greek letters, with boldface font indicating vectors/matrices. In most models, \\(y\\) will denote the univariate response, \\(X\\) will describe a matrix of predictor variables, and \\(e\\) a vector of random errors. The Greek letter \\(\\beta\\) will be commonly used for regression parameters (either with subscripts for each values as in \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1\\) or as a vector (as in \\(X\\beta\\)). The letters \\(i, j, k,\\) and \\(l\\) will be most commonly used as subscripts or indices. In the effects formulation of ANOVA models, additional greek letters (\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\gamma\\), etc.) will appear as parameter effects, as will \\(\\mu\\), which will typically represent the grand mean. Group-specfic means will be denoted via subscripts: \\(\\mu_{ij}\\). "]
