Our approach emphasizes the problems researchers encounter rather than providing a litany of solutions with only modest context. We discuss a real scientific problem, thoughtfully consider the data that could be used to answer that problem, investigate experimental designs that would be useful, and pursue statistical models to make informed decisions in the context of how the data was collected. The focus of the book is on the statistical modeling portion but problems are viewed holistically. We purposefully introduce the linear model framework in matrix form early on and place most of the methodologies under that umbrella. This helps the reader to see the methods as a part of a general framework as opposed to a set of tools within a toolbox. We believe that the book should be appropriate for a graduate level student that has some comfort in mathematics, particularly linear algebra. Both SAS and R are used throughout to make sure the book works for a wide audience of practitioners. 1.2 Software At this point, software is a requirement for statistics in practice. There are many available software solutions ranging from point and click to full on programming. We’ve decided to focus on R and SAS for this book. R is an open source, platform agnostic, software that is widely used by statisticians. We’ll use the RStudio interactive development environment to write and execute our R code. SAS requires a license but is an extremely powerful software for doing modeling and is used widely enough to merit inclusion here. For those without a license, SAS University Edition can be installed for free and is also platform agnostic. We’ll use the SAS Studio environment that comes with University Edition. As we progress through the book we’ll include graphs, descriptive statistics, and analyses from R and/or SAS. At the end of each chapter a section explaining how to create these in both R and SAS is included. The following sections give a brief introduction to each software that should prepare you for what’s ahead! You’ll also notice a certain style to the way our code is written. Good programming practices (GPPs) are essential for improving productivity and collaborating with others - including future you! There are a lot of guidelines and resources about GPPs available. We’ll cover just a few of the essentials here. Include a header at the top of the program that gives the author, date, and purpose of the program. Place comments throughout the program explaining the purpose of different chunks of code as well as your thought process. Spacing and indentation should be used throughout for readability of the program. Group sections of your code that serve a certain purpose together. Use a consistent naming scheme such as camelCase or underscores_between_words. Many of these and other GPPs can be taken care of by programming in a notebook environment such as JUPYTER (which can include SAS) or R Markdown. Also using a version control software such as Git and Github is really useful! 1.3 R The general workflow for programming in R involves taking raw data and importing it into R. Once that data is imported we often create numerical and graphical summaries of the data. The appropriate model or statistical method is then applied. At the end of this section the reader should be able to do the following: install R and RStudio read and write basic R programs import well-formatted data into R do basic data manipulation in R As the book progresses the steps of summarizing and analyzing the data will be covered. Let’s get started! 1.3.1 Installing R and RStudio The R software itself can be downloaded and installed by visiting the Comprehensive R Archive Network (Cran) website. Here there are links to install R for Linux, Mac, and Windows-based machines. For Windows users, follow the initial ‘Download R for Windows’ link and then click ‘install R for the first time.’ From here you should now see a Download R X.x.x for Windows link that will download a .exe file. Once downloaded run that file and follow the prompts. For Mac users, follow the initial ‘Download R for (Mac) OS X’ link and click on the link near the ‘Latest Release’ section similar to R-x.x.x.pkg. Once downloaded, you should be able to install by double clicking on the file. For Linux users, follow the initial ‘Download R for Linux’ link. Choose your OS and instructions are given on how to download R. Once you’ve installed R you’ll want to install RStudio. RStudio is a well-developed environment that makes programming in R much easier! To download head to RStudio’s download page. From here choose RStudio Desktop (Open Source License) and a page with appropriate links to install are provided. 1.3.2 Using RStudio To program in R you’ll want to open RStudio. RStudio will submit R code for you so you never actually need to open R itself. There are four main ‘areas’ of the RStudio IDE: Console (&amp; Terminal) Scripting and Viewing Window Plots/Help (&amp; Files/Packages) Environment (&amp; Connections/Git) You may wish to rearrange the panes. This can be done via the menus at the top. Choose “Tools –&gt; Global Options”. Other useful global options to change are under the appearance tab (font size, theme) and under the code tab (editing –&gt; soft-wrap, display –&gt; show whitespace). 1.3.2.1 Console To evaluate code you can type directly into the console. #simple math operations # &lt;-- is a comment - code not evaluated 3 + 7 ## [1] 10 10 * exp(3) #exp is exponential function ## [1] 200.8554 log(pi^2) #log is natural log by default ## [1] 2.28946 mean(cars$speed) ## [1] 15.4 hist(cars$speed) In the R sections of the book we spend much of our time learning the R syntax needed to create the appropriate summaries or analysis. 1.3.2.2 Scripting and Viewing Window Usually you don’t want to type code directly into the console because there isn’t an easy way to get the code for later use. Instead code is usually written in an R ‘script’ which is then saved. From an R script you can send code to console via: “Run” button (runs current line) CTRL+Enter (PC) or Command+Enter (MAC) Highlight section and do above To create a new R script you can use the menus at the top and go to File –&gt; New File –&gt; R Script. Take a moment and do this! Type the following into your script: View(cars) (note capital V) plot(cars) Submit it to the console using a button or hot key! 1.3.2.3 Plots/Help Created plots are stored in the Plots tab. This is a nice feature that allows you to cycle through past plots and easily save plots via menus. In this pane there is also a Help tab that will enable you to learn about R functions. In the console type help(hist) for instance. Information about the hist function is presented. Being able to parse these types of help files is a really useful skill! For every R function there are a few sections: Description - What the function is intended for. Usage - How to call the function, inputs required, and which inputs have default arguments. Here we see hist(x, ...). This implies there is only one required input, x, and there is no default. Below you see a more detailed call to hist that includes other inputs. Each of these inputs has an equal sign with a value after it. This is the default value for that input (since there is a default value you don’t have to specify it when you call). For instance, the breaks = \"Sturges\" input implies that the “Sturges” method is the default for determining how the bins of the histogram are created. Arguments - Describes the input requirements in more detail. Details - Information about how the function works. Values - Information about what is returned to the user. References See Also - Related functions. Examples - Highly useful section giving code you can copy and paste to see an example of how the function can be used. 1.3.2.4 Environment R stores data/info/functions/etc. in R objects. An object is a data structure having attributes and methods (more on this shortly). You can create an R object via &lt;- (recommended) or =. #save for later avg &lt;- (5 + 7 + 6) / 3 #call avg object avg ## [1] 6 #strings (text) can be saved as well words &lt;- c(&quot;Hello there!&quot;, &quot;How are you?&quot;) words ## [1] &quot;Hello there!&quot; &quot;How are you?&quot; Notice that when you send the line avg &lt;- (5+ 7 + 6) / 3 to the console (i.e. create the object avg) that nothing prints out. This is common behavior when storing the object. The output or information is saved for later use in the object. To see the output or information you then simply call the object (a default printing method is used to display it). You can look at all current objects with ls(). ls() ## [1] &quot;avg&quot; &quot;words&quot; Use rm() to remove an object. rm(avg) ls() ## [1] &quot;words&quot; Built-in objects exist like letters and cars. letters ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; ## [20] &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; head(cars, n = 3) ## speed dist ## 1 4 2 ## 2 4 10 ## 3 7 4 The function data() shows available built-in datasets. You should now be roughly familiar with the four main ‘areas’ of the RStudio IDE: Console (&amp; Terminal) Scripting and Viewing Window Plots/Help (&amp; Files/Packages) Environment (&amp; Connections/Git) 1.3.3 R Objects and Classes R has strong Object Oriented Programming (OOP) tools. Object: data structure with attributes (class) Method: procedures (functions) that act on object based on attributes R functions like print() or plot() act differently depending on an object’s class. class(cars) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; plot(cars) class(exp) ## [1] &quot;function&quot; plot(exp) Many R functions exist to help understand an R Object. str() (structure) str(cars) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 50 obs. of 2 variables: ## $ speed: num 4 4 7 7 8 9 10 10 10 11 ... ## $ dist : num 2 10 4 22 16 10 18 26 34 17 ... class() class(cars) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; typeof() typeof(cars) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; We’ll use these functions later to help us know how to extra information from an R object. Recall that we can create an R object via &lt;- (recommended) or =. This allocates computer memory to object. The object’s attributes depend on how you created it. vec &lt;- c(1, 4, 10) class(vec) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; fit &lt;- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) class(fit) ## [1] &quot;lm&quot; 1.3.4 Data Objects To understand how to use R for data analysis we need to understand commonly used data structures: 1. Atomic Vector (1D) 2. Matrix (2D) 3. Array (nd) (not covered) 4. Data Frame (2D) 5. List (1D) 1.3.4.1 Atomic Vector Let’s start with the most basic object and work our way up. An atomic vector is a 1D group of elements with an ordering. All of the elements must be same ‘type’. Types include numeric (integer or double), character, or logical. We create an atomic vector with the c() function (‘combine’). #vectors (1 dimensional) objects x &lt;- c(17, 22, 1, 3, -3) y &lt;- c(&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;, &quot;frog&quot;) x ## [1] 17 22 1 3 -3 y ## [1] &quot;cat&quot; &quot;dog&quot; &quot;bird&quot; &quot;frog&quot; In addition, many ‘functions’ output a numeric vector. Functions are at the heart of R so it is vital to understand them. The concept of a function is that there the function takes an input or inputs and maps those inputs to some output(s). As an example, one function that outputs a numeric vector is the seq or sequence function. To know about a function you need to know about the inputs and ouputs. For seq we have the following: + Inputs = from, to, by (among others) + Output = a sequence of numbers v &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1) v ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 str(v) ## num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5 str tells about the object v: num says it is numeric [1:5] implies one dimensional with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 The seq function is used quite a bit. There is a shorthand way to create an integer sequence using :. 1:20 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 It is also important to know how R does math on its objects. R does elementwise addition/subtraction and multiplication/division to vectors, matrices, and data frames. (The matrix multiplicaiton operator is %*%.). 1:20/20 ## [1] 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 ## [16] 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 1:20 + 1 ## [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 As we mentioned earlier, understanding help files is really useful to being about to program in R. As functions are ubiquitous in R we often need to learn about their inputs (or arguments) and we can do so using help. To recap, our first commonly used R object for storing data is an atomic vectore. This is a 1D group of elements with an ordering where all of the elements are of the same type. Generally vectors are useful to know about but not usually useful for a storing a dataset exactly. They can often be considered as the ‘building blocks’ for other data types. 1.3.4.2 Matrix A Matrix is a 2D data structure in R whose elements are all of the same type. The first dimension refers to the rows and the second dimension refers to the columns. A 2D data object is very common. The rows often represent the observations and the columns represent the variables. Although not technically right, it is useful to think of the columns of a matrix as vectors of the same type and length. For instance, consider the three vectors created here: #populate vectors x &lt;- c(17, 3, 13, 11) y &lt;- rep(-3, times = 4) z &lt;- 1:4 These are all of the same type. This can be checked with an is. (read as ‘is dot’) function. #check &#39;type&#39; is.numeric(x) ## [1] TRUE is.numeric(y) ## [1] TRUE is.numeric(z) ## [1] TRUE Not only are these three objects the same type but they are also the same length. This can be checked using the length function. #check &#39;length&#39; length(x) ## [1] 4 length(y) ## [1] 4 length(z) ## [1] 4 Again, it is useful to visualize the columns of a potential matrix as these vectors. We can create the matrix using the matrix function. The matrix function requires us to give the data as one vector. We can combine the x, y, and z objects into one vector using the c funciton. This is the first argument to the matrix function. The only other argument required is to either specify the number of rows (nrow =) or the number of columns (ncol =) (R will attempt to figure out the one that is not given using the total length of the specified data vector). #combine in a matrix matrix(c(x, y, z), ncol = 3) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 17 -3 1 ## [2,] 3 -3 2 ## [3,] 13 -3 3 ## [4,] 11 -3 4 A matrix can also store character data as well. An example of this is given below and the number of rows is specified rather than the number of columns. Note the use of is.character from the is. family of functions. x &lt;- c(&quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;There&quot;, &quot;!&quot;) y &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) z &lt;- c(&quot;One&quot;, &quot;Two&quot;, &quot;Three&quot;) is.character(x) ## [1] TRUE matrix(c(x, y, z), nrow = 3) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] &quot;Hi&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;One&quot; ## [2,] &quot;There&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;Two&quot; ## [3,] &quot;!&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;Three&quot; To recap, a Matrix is a 2D data structure where we can think of the columns as vectors of the same type and length. These are useful for some datasets but most datasets have some numeric and some character variables. Another 2D object called a data frame is perfect for this type of data! 1.3.4.3 Data Frame A Data Frame is a 2D data structure where elements within a column must be of the same type but the columns themselves can differ in type. When thinking of a data frame, consider them as a collection (list) of vectors of the same length. A data frame can be created with the data.frame function. x &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;) y &lt;- c(1, 3, 4, -1, 5, 6) z &lt;- 10:15 data.frame(x, y, z) ## x y z ## 1 a 1 10 ## 2 b 3 11 ## 3 c 4 12 ## 4 d -1 13 ## 5 e 5 14 ## 6 f 6 15 You can also easily name the columns during creation. data.frame(char = x, data1 = y, data2 = z) ## char data1 data2 ## 1 a 1 10 ## 2 b 3 11 ## 3 c 4 12 ## 4 d -1 13 ## 5 e 5 14 ## 6 f 6 15 Notice that char, data1, and data2 become the variable names for the data frame. To recap, consider a data frame as a collection (list) of vectors of the same length. Tis type of data structure is perfect for most data sets! Most functions that read 2D data into R store it as a data frame. 1.3.4.4 List A List is a 1D group of objects with ordering. Really it is a vector that can have differing elements. Think of this in a similar way to the atomic vector previously discussed except the elements are really flexible. A list can be created with the list function. You specify the elements you want to include, separated by commas. list(1:3, rnorm(2), c(&quot;!&quot;, &quot;?&quot;)) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] -0.766200 -1.518331 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] &quot;!&quot; &quot;?&quot; Similar to a data frame, you can add names to the list elements during creation. list(seq = 1:3, normVals = rnorm(2), punctuation = c(&quot;!&quot;, &quot;?&quot;)) ## $seq ## [1] 1 2 3 ## ## $normVals ## [1] -0.5307399 -0.4115262 ## ## $punctuation ## [1] &quot;!&quot; &quot;?&quot; To recap, a list is a very flexible 1D object. It is really useful for more complex types of data. The table below gives a summary of the data objects we’ve covered. For most data analysis you’ll use data frames. Dimension Homogeneous Heterogeneous 1d Atomic Vector List 2d Matrix Data Frame Next we look at how to access or change parts of our these common data objects. 1.3.5 Accessing Common Data Objects When we are dealing with a data object (1D or 2D) we may want to extract a single element, certain columns, or certain rows. In this section we’ll look at how to subset or extract information from each of the common data objects covered in the previous section. 1.3.5.1 Atomic Vector (1D) For atomic vectors (and lists, see later) you can return elements using square brackets []. You may notice that when R prints a vector to the console you often see [1] next to the first element and perhaps a [#] where R has to break and move to the next line of the console. The [1] implies the element printed next is the first element of the vector (R starts its counting at 1 not 0 like some other languages). The [#] implies that the element printed to the right is the # element of the vector. This is a good reminder of how to extract values from an atomic vector. As an example, here we extract from a built-in R object called letters that is a vector of length 26 containing the letters of the alphabet. letters #built-in vector ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; ## [20] &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; letters[1] #R starts counting at 1! ## [1] &quot;a&quot; letters[26] ## [1] &quot;z&quot; To obtain more than one element you can ‘feed’ in a vector of indices to that you’d like to return. letters[1:4] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; letters[c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)] ## [1] &quot;e&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;y&quot; x &lt;- c(1, 2, 5) letters[x] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;e&quot; If you’d like to return all values except a certain subset, you can use negative indices. letters[-(1:4)] ## [1] &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; ## [20] &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; x &lt;- c(1, 2, 5) letters[-x] ## [1] &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; ## [20] &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; 1.3.5.2 Matrices (2D) For rectangular data like a matrix you can return rectangular subsets using square brackets with a comma [ , ]. Notice default row and column names when R prints a matrix! mat &lt;- matrix(c(1:4, 20:17), ncol = 2) mat ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 20 ## [2,] 2 19 ## [3,] 3 18 ## [4,] 4 17 This is a nice reminder of how to index a matrix. The value prior to the columns represents which row(s) you want to return and the value after the comma which column(s). If an index is left blank then all of that corresponding dimension (row or column) is returned. mat[c(2, 4), ] ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 2 19 ## [2,] 4 17 mat[, 1] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 mat[2, ] ## [1] 2 19 mat[2, 1] ## [1] 2 Notice that R simplifies the result where possible. That is, returns an atomic vector if you have only 1 dimension and a matrix if two. This can be changed by adding an additional argument to the [ function. mat[ , 1, drop = FALSE] ## [,1] ## [1,] 1 ## [2,] 2 ## [3,] 3 ## [4,] 4 Also, if you only give a single value in the [] then R uses the count of the value in the matrix. Counts go down columns first. mat[5] ## [1] 20 If your matrix has column names associated with it, you can also use those to return columns of interest. To add column names we can look run help(matrix) to learn how! Notice the dimnames argument. You can specify names for the rows and columns by using a list with two vectors. The first vector indicating row names and the second column names. If we don’t want to give rownames we can give a NULL (a special value in R that is used for undefined values - here giving no specification of row names). We can do this and give a character vector for the column names. mat&lt;-matrix(c(1:4, 20:17), ncol = 2, dimnames = list(NULL, c(&quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;)) ) mat ## First Second ## [1,] 1 20 ## [2,] 2 19 ## [3,] 3 18 ## [4,] 4 17 Now we can request columns be using a single name or a character vector of names. mat[, &quot;First&quot;] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 To return all but certain parts of a matrix you can still use negative indices but note that this won’t work with column names. mat[-c(1,3), -&quot;First&quot;] ## Error in -&quot;First&quot;: invalid argument to unary operator mat[-c(1,3), &quot;First&quot;] ## [1] 2 4 1.3.5.3 Data Frames (2D) Since a data frame is also a rectangular data object you can return rectangular subsets using square brackets with a comma [ , ]! As an example, we’ll subset the built-in iris data frame. To get an idea about this object we can run str(iris). str(iris) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 150 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ Sepal.Length: num 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ... ## $ Sepal.Width : num 3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ... ## $ Petal.Length: num 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ... ## $ Petal.Width : num 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ... ## $ Species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... We can see this is a data frame with a few columns, four are numeric and one is a factor (a special type of character vector essentially - these will be covered when we discuss plotting). iris[1:4, 2:4] ## Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## 1 3.5 1.4 0.2 ## 2 3.0 1.4 0.2 ## 3 3.2 1.3 0.2 ## 4 3.1 1.5 0.2 iris[1, ] ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa iris[, 1] ## [1] 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 5.4 4.6 5.0 4.4 4.9 5.4 4.8 4.8 4.3 5.8 5.7 5.4 5.1 ## [19] 5.7 5.1 5.4 5.1 4.6 5.1 4.8 5.0 5.0 5.2 5.2 4.7 4.8 5.4 5.2 5.5 4.9 5.0 ## [37] 5.5 4.9 4.4 5.1 5.0 4.5 4.4 5.0 5.1 4.8 5.1 4.6 5.3 5.0 7.0 6.4 6.9 5.5 ## [55] 6.5 5.7 6.3 4.9 6.6 5.2 5.0 5.9 6.0 6.1 5.6 6.7 5.6 5.8 6.2 5.6 5.9 6.1 ## [73] 6.3 6.1 6.4 6.6 6.8 6.7 6.0 5.7 5.5 5.5 5.8 6.0 5.4 6.0 6.7 6.3 5.6 5.5 ## [91] 5.5 6.1 5.8 5.0 5.6 5.7 5.7 6.2 5.1 5.7 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 50 entries ] Notice the simplification done when a single column is selected. R will simplify to a vector unless drop = FALSE is included as done in the matrix section. (The simplification doesn’t occur when a single row is selected because data frames are actually lists - we’ll discuss this more in the list section!) You can use columns names to subset as well. iris[1:10 , c(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;)] ## Sepal.Length Species ## 1 5.1 setosa ## 2 4.9 setosa ## 3 4.7 setosa ## 4 4.6 setosa ## 5 5.0 setosa ## 6 5.4 setosa ## 7 4.6 setosa ## 8 5.0 setosa ## 9 4.4 setosa ## 10 4.9 setosa The most common way to access a single columns is to use the dollar sign operator. iris$Sepal.Length ## [1] 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 5.4 4.6 5.0 4.4 4.9 5.4 4.8 4.8 4.3 5.8 5.7 5.4 5.1 ## [19] 5.7 5.1 5.4 5.1 4.6 5.1 4.8 5.0 5.0 5.2 5.2 4.7 4.8 5.4 5.2 5.5 4.9 5.0 ## [37] 5.5 4.9 4.4 5.1 5.0 4.5 4.4 5.0 5.1 4.8 5.1 4.6 5.3 5.0 7.0 6.4 6.9 5.5 ## [55] 6.5 5.7 6.3 4.9 6.6 5.2 5.0 5.9 6.0 6.1 5.6 6.7 5.6 5.8 6.2 5.6 5.9 6.1 ## [73] 6.3 6.1 6.4 6.6 6.8 6.7 6.0 5.7 5.5 5.5 5.8 6.0 5.4 6.0 6.7 6.3 5.6 5.5 ## [91] 5.5 6.1 5.8 5.0 5.6 5.7 5.7 6.2 5.1 5.7 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 50 entries ] A nice benefit of using RStudio is that column names will be filled in automatically as you type.

The major difference is in whether or not a list with the element chosen is returned or just the element itself. [[ will return just the element requested. x &lt;- list(&quot;HI&quot;, c(10:20), 1) x[1] ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;HI&quot; x[[1]] ## [1] &quot;HI&quot; x[[2]] ## [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 x[[2]][4:5] ## [1] 13 14 Recall we could name our list elements.

Our plan for this section is as follows: Look at common raw data formats Take a few quick asides: R projects, factors, and R packages Read ‘clean’ delimited data Read Excel, SAS, &amp; SPSS data Resources for JSON data, XML data, databases, and APIs How to read in data depends on raw/external data type! We’ll start by focusing on delimited data. Delimiter - Character (such as a,) that separates data entries To read in data we’ll need functions to do so. When you open R a few packages are loaded. R Packages: Collection of functions/datasets/etc. in one place Packages exist to do almost anything List of CRAN approved packages on R’s website Plenty of other packages on places like GitHub The utils package that automatically loads has a family of read. functions ready for use! Reading data with these functions is often referred to as reading with a standard R or base R method. Function and purpose: Type of Delimeter Function Comma read.csv() Semicolon (, for decimal) read.csv2() Tab read.delim() White Space/General read.table(sep = \"\") Each of these functions requires a path to the file in order to read it in. Let’s read in the ‘neuralgia.csv’ file. This is a comma separated value file (.csv). This requires the read.csv function. R locates the file by the path you give it. You can give full path name. For example, ex: C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods/datasets/neuralgia.csv ex: C:\\\\Users\\\\jbpost2\\\\repos\\\\StatisticalMethods\\\\datasets\\\\neuralgia.csv Notice that a double \\ is needed because \\ is an escape character in R so \\\\ is really read as \\. Ok, let’s read in the neuralgia csv file using read.csv. neuralgiaData &lt;- read.csv( &quot;C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods/datasets/neuralgia.csv&quot; ) head(neuralgiaData) ## Treatment Sex Age Duration Pain ## 1 P F 68 1 No ## 2 B M 74 16 No ## 3 P F 67 30 No ## 4 P M 66 26 Yes ## 5 B F 67 28 No ## 6 B F 77 16 No Pretty simply if the data is nicely formatted! Using a full local path not recommended though! Doing so makes it difficult to share code without having to go in and change the paths. Instead, you can change the working directory R is using. That is, the folder by default R is ‘looking’ for files. Then we can supply a relative path. As long as other users have the same folder structure as you (say if you are using a github repo), no changes need to be made for them to run the code! We can determine the working directory using getwd. getwd() ## [1] &quot;C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods&quot; This can be changed using setwd. setwd(&quot;C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods/datasets&quot;) #or setwd(&quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\jbpost2\\\\repos\\\\StatisticalMethods\\\\datasets&quot;) The working directory can also be changed via the menus in RStudio. Another way to supply a path is via a URL. This is really handy if you have a place to host your datasets! neuralgiaData &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv&quot;) To recap, to read a csv file you can Use full local path (not recommended) Use relative path set working directory with setwd() Pull from a URL 1.3.8 Quick Aside: RStudio Project Often we have many files associated with an analysis. When working on multiple undertakings things get cluttered in R… With each analysis we may want to associate different + environments + histories + working directories + source documents The “Project” feature in R Studio allows us to easily do this! To create you can use the drop down menus. Now you can easily switch between analyses by using “File –&gt; Open Project” or by using the little drop down menu in the top right of RStudio. 1.3.9 Quick Aside: Factors As mentioned above there are read. functions for many different types of delimited data. These functions work really well but there are a few areas they could be improved. A poor default function behavior as strings are read as factors Understanding factors is important enough to warrant a quick discussion. Let’s look at the structure of our neuralgiaData object we read in with read.csv. str(neuralgiaData) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 60 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ Treatment: Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;P&quot;: 3 2 3 3 2 2 1 2 2 1 ... ## $ Sex : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;F&quot;,&quot;M&quot;: 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 ... ## $ Age : int 68 74 67 66 67 77 71 72 76 71 ... ## $ Duration : int 1 16 30 26 28 16 12 50 9 17 ... ## $ Pain : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;: 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 ... We can see that all of the character variables are Factor vectors. A factor is a special class of vector with a levels attribute. The levels define all possible values for that variable. This is a great concept for a variable that can only take on certain values such as Day (Monday, Tuesday, …, Sunday). However, if you have a variable like Name that you will eventually add new values (levels) to factors become a bit of a nuisance. For example, in the neuralgia dataset we may have a fourth treatment we want to add to the Treatment variable. Let’s try to assign the first observation value with a ‘new’ treatment called ‘M’. neuralgiaData$Treatment ## [1] P B P P B B A B B A A A B A P A P A P B B A A A B P B B P P A A B B B A P B ## [39] B P P P A B A P P A B P P P B A P A P A B A ## Levels: A B P neuralgiaData$Treatment[1] &lt;- &quot;M&quot; ## Warning in `[&lt;-.factor`(`*tmp*`, 1, value = structure(c(NA, 2L, 3L, 3L, : ## invalid factor level, NA generated We can see this throws an error because ‘M’ is not one of the levels defined for the variable. To add the new value we have to alter the levels attribute of the factor. #overwrite with another possible level levels(neuralgiaData$Treatment) &lt;- c(levels(neuralgiaData$Treatment), &quot;M&quot;) levels(neuralgiaData$Treatment) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;M&quot; neuralgiaData$Treatment[1] &lt;- &quot;M&quot; Factors are very useful for plotting as we’ll see later. For the other issues with the read. family we can look at useful functions from other R packages. R packages deserve a brief discussion as well! 1.3.10 Quick Aside: R Packages An R package is a collection of functions in one place. There are tons of packages to do most anything. In particular a group of packages called the “TidyVerse” has modernized the use of R for a larger audience. The tidyverse is a package that is a collection of eight R packages that share common philosophies and are designed to work together! One of these packages, readr, is extremely useful for reading in data and remedies the concerns mentioned above about the read. family of functions. The first time using a package you must ‘install’ the package (download the files). You can do this Using code: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) #can do multiple packages at once install.packages(c(&quot;readr&quot;, &quot;readxl&quot;, &quot;haven&quot;, &quot;DBI&quot;, &quot;httr&quot;)) Using menus: Note that you can also install packages from local sources (such as a downloaded .zip or .tar) but that isn’t usually required unless you are behind a firewall or R updates and the packages haven’t bene updated for that version of R. The good thing is that you only need to install the packages once! However, this doesn’t mean you have direct access to your package functions or datasets in your R session. Each R session you open you need to read in the package using library() or require(). library(&quot;readr&quot;) ## Warning: package &#39;readr&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 require(&quot;haven&quot;) ## Loading required package: haven ## Warning: package &#39;haven&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 These functions are very similar; they both give you direct access to the functions or data in your R session. The difference is that if you try to load a package that doesn’t exist library throws an error where require() returns FALSE. library(&quot;notAPackage&quot;) ## Error in library(&quot;notAPackage&quot;): there is no package called &#39;notAPackage&#39; require(&quot;notAPackage&quot;) ## Loading required package: notAPackage ## Warning in library(package, lib.loc = lib.loc, character.only = TRUE, ## logical.return = TRUE, : there is no package called &#39;notAPackage&#39; Now is a good time to install the tidyverse package if you haven’t already. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) The functions in the tidyverse generally have Fast code Easy syntax Good default settings on functions A nice set of examples and vignettes Read the package into your R session. library(tidyverse) ## Warning: package &#39;tidyverse&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 ## -- Attaching packages ----------------------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.0 -- ## v ggplot2 3.2.1 v dplyr 0.8.3 ## v tibble 2.1.3 v stringr 1.4.0 ## v tidyr 1.0.0 v forcats 0.4.0 ## v purrr 0.3.3 ## Warning: package &#39;ggplot2&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 ## Warning: package &#39;tibble&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 ## Warning: package &#39;tidyr&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 ## Warning: package &#39;purrr&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 ## Warning: package &#39;dplyr&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 ## Warning: package &#39;stringr&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 ## Warning: package &#39;forcats&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 ## -- Conflicts -------------------------------------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() -- ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() You’ll likely see a message about functions being masked. This implies that one of the functions just loaded has a function under the same name as a function that already exists. If you type help(filter), R will now give you an option of which filter to look at. R uses the most recently loaded function and “masks” the old ones. You can access specific package’s functions using ::. This allows you to call functions without loading a full library. readr::read_csv(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## Treatment = col_character(), ## Sex = col_character(), ## Age = col_double(), ## Duration = col_double(), ## Pain = col_character() ## ) ## # A tibble: 60 x 5 ## Treatment Sex Age Duration Pain ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 P F 68 1 No ## 2 B M 74 16 No ## 3 P F 67 30 No ## 4 P M 66 26 Yes ## 5 B F 67 28 No ## # ... with 55 more rows 1.3.11 Reading Delimited Data Again the read. functions exist to read in many different types of delimited data. These functions work really well but there are a few areas they could be improved. A poor default function behavior as strings are read as factors Raw data row &amp; column names can be troublesome Slow processing (relatively speaking) (Slightly) different behavior on different computers Functions from the tidyverse (and readr in particular) remedy all of these! Type of Delimeter utils Function readr Comma read.csv() read_csv() Semicolon (, for decimal) read.csv2() read_csv2() Tab read.delim() read_tsv() General read.table(sep = \"\") read_delim() White Space read.table(sep = \"\") read_table() read_table2() Let’s reread the ‘neuralgia.csv’ file using read_csv from the readr package. neuralgiaData &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## Treatment = col_character(), ## Sex = col_character(), ## Age = col_double(), ## Duration = col_double(), ## Pain = col_character() ## ) You can see that the package displays a bit of information about how the data was parsed. neuralgiaData ## # A tibble: 60 x 5 ## Treatment Sex Age Duration Pain ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 P F 68 1 No ## 2 B M 74 16 No ## 3 P F 67 30 No ## 4 P M 66 26 Yes ## 5 B F 67 28 No ## # ... with 55 more rows You’ll also notice the fancy printing. This gives a quick check for the column type you have, which is a basic data validation step. The tidyverse has a special class of data frames called tibbles. class(neuralgiaData) ## [1] &quot;spec_tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; The behavior of tibbles is slightly different than that of a standard data frame. One is the printing method. The other major difference is that tibbles don’t simplify. neuralgiaData[,1] ## # A tibble: 60 x 1 ## Treatment ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 P ## 2 B ## 3 P ## 4 P ## 5 B ## # ... with 55 more rows as.data.frame(neuralgiaData)[,1] ## [1] &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [20] &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## [39] &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [58] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; As this behavior can cause some issues with functions that are expecting a vector it is useful to force simplification sometimes. You can either use the pull function or the $ operator to return a column as a vector. pull(neuralgiaData, 1) ## [1] &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [20] &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## [39] &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [58] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; neuralgiaData$Treatment ## [1] &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [20] &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## [39] &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [58] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; One question you may have about the column types is, how did R determine the column types? The help file for read_csv tells us that it checks the first 1000 rows of data and uses those to figure out the type of data. You can of course override this default behavior. Some useful inputs you may want to change when reading in data are skip = 0 col_names = TRUE na = c(\"\", \"NA\") These allow you to skip lines of data, specify column names, and define what represents a missing value in the raw data (NA is the missing data indicator in R). Generally, reading clean delimited data pretty easy with the read_ family of functions! Let’s go through a few examples. First, let’s read in the space delimited file ‘chemical.txt’. Since this is space delimited we’ll use read_table. read_table(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/chemical.txt&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## `temp conc time percent` = col_character() ## ) ## # A tibble: 19 x 1 ## `temp conc time percent` ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 -1 -1 -1 45.9 ## 2 1 -1 -1 60.6 ## 3 -1 1 -1 57.5 ## 4 1 1 -1 58.6 ## 5 -1 -1 1 53.3 ## 6 1 -1 1 58 ## 7 -1 1 1 58.8 ## 8 1 1 1 52.4 ## 9 -2 0 0 46.9 ## 10 2 0 0 55.4 ## 11 0 -2 0 55 ## 12 0 2 0 57.5 ## 13 0 0 -2 56.3 ## 14 0 0 2 58.9 ## 15 0 0 0 56.9 ## 16 2 -3 0 61.1 ## 17 2 -3 0 62.9 ## 18 -1.4 2.6 0.7 60 ## 19 -1.4 2.6 0.7 60.6 Next, let’s read in the tab delimited file ‘crabs.txt’. Since this is tab delimited we’ll use read_tsv. read_tsv(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/crabs.txt&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## color = col_double(), ## spine = col_double(), ## width = col_double(), ## satell = col_double(), ## weight = col_double(), ## y = col_double() ## ) ## # A tibble: 173 x 6 ## color spine width satell weight y ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3 3 28.3 8 3050 1 ## 2 4 3 22.5 0 1550 0 ## 3 2 1 26 9 2300 1 ## 4 4 3 24.8 0 2100 0 ## 5 4 3 26 4 2600 1 ## # ... with 168 more rows Lastly, let’s read in the &gt; delimited file ‘umps2012.txt’. As this isn’t a standard delimiter we’ll use read_delim and specify the delim = input. However, this file doesn’t contain column names in the raw data. The columns represent Year, Month, Day, Home, Away, and HPUmpire. The column names can be specified using the col_names input and specifying them with a character vector. read_delim(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/umps2012.txt&quot;, delim = &quot;&gt;&quot;, col_names = c(&quot;Year&quot;, &quot;Month&quot;, &quot;Day&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Away&quot;, &quot;HPUmpire&quot;)) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## Year = col_double(), ## Month = col_double(), ## Day = col_double(), ## Home = col_character(), ## Away = col_character(), ## HPUmpire = col_character() ## ) ## # A tibble: 2,359 x 6 ## Year Month Day Home Away HPUmpire ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2012 4 12 MIN LAA D.J.

Type of file Package Function Delimited readr read_csv(), read_tsv(),read_table(), read_delim() Excel (.xls,.xlsx) readxl read_excel() SAS (.sas7bdat) haven read_sas() SPSS (.sav) haven read_spss() Let’s read in the censusEd.xlsx file.This can be done with the read_excel() from readxl package! This funcion reads in both xls and xlsx files. It detects the format from the file extension given in the path name. One issue is that excel files can be read from the web so they do need to be downloaded locally. #install package if necessary library(readxl) ## Warning: package &#39;readxl&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 #reads first sheet by default edData &lt;- read_excel(&quot;datasets/censusEd.xlsx&quot;) edData ## # A tibble: 3,198 x 42 ## Area_name STCOU EDU010187F EDU010187D EDU010187N1 EDU010187N2 EDU010188F ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 UNITED S~ 00000 0 40024299 0000 0000 0 ## 2 ALABAMA 01000 0 733735 0000 0000 0 ## 3 Autauga,~ 01001 0 6829 0000 0000 0 ## 4 Baldwin,~ 01003 0 16417 0000 0000 0 ## 5 Barbour,~ 01005 0 5071 0000 0000 0 ## # ... with 3,193 more rows, and 35 more variables: EDU010188D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010188N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010188N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010189F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010189D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010189N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010189N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010190F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010190D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010190N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010190N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010191F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010191D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010191N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010191N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010192F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010192D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010192N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010192N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010193F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010193D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010193N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010193N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010194F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010194D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010194N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010194N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010195F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010195D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010195N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010195N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010196F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010196D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010196N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010196N2 &lt;chr&gt; If you want to read in a sheet other than the first sheet, you can do so with the sheet = argument. To look at the available sheets without opening in Excel you can use the excel_sheets function. excel_sheets(&quot;datasets/censusEd.xlsx&quot;) ## [1] &quot;EDU01A&quot; &quot;EDU01B&quot; &quot;EDU01C&quot; &quot;EDU01D&quot; &quot;EDU01E&quot; &quot;EDU01F&quot; &quot;EDU01G&quot; &quot;EDU01H&quot; ## [9] &quot;EDU01I&quot; &quot;EDU01J&quot; read_excel(&quot;datasets/censusEd.xlsx&quot;, sheet = &quot;EDU01D&quot;) There are also ways to specify which cells to read in with the range = argument. You can select cells that are contiguous only (next to each other). edData &lt;- read_excel(&quot;datasets/censusEd.xlsx&quot;, sheet = &quot;EDU01A&quot;, range = cell_cols(&quot;A:D&quot;)) edData ## # A tibble: 3,198 x 4 ## Area_name STCOU EDU010187F EDU010187D ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 UNITED STATES 00000 0 40024299 ## 2 ALABAMA 01000 0 733735 ## 3 Autauga, AL 01001 0 6829 ## 4 Baldwin, AL 01003 0 16417 ## 5 Barbour, AL 01005 0 5071 ## # ... with 3,193 more rows 1.3.13 SAS Data SAS datasets have a file extension of ‘.sas7bdat’. Let’s read in the smoke2003.sas7bdat dataset. This can be done using the read_sas function from the haven package. As .sas7bdat files are pretty structured there aren’t many options to use with this function. #install if necessary library(haven) smokeData &lt;- read_sas(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/smoke2003.sas7bdat&quot;) smokeData ## # A tibble: 443 x 54 ## SEQN SDDSRVYR RIDSTATR RIDEXMON RIAGENDR RIDAGEYR RIDAGEMN RIDAGEEX RIDRETH1 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 21010 3 2 2 2 52 633 634 3 ## 2 21012 3 2 2 1 63 765 766 4 ## 3 21048 3 2 1 2 42 504 504 1 ## 4 21084 3 2 1 2 57 692 693 3 ## 5 21093 3 2 1 2 64 778 778 2 ## # ... with 438 more rows, and 45 more variables: RIDRETH2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # DMQMILIT &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDBORN &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDCITZN &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDYRSUS &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # DMDEDUC3 &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDEDUC2 &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDEDUC &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDSCHOL &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # DMDMARTL &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDHHSIZ &lt;dbl&gt;, INDHHINC &lt;dbl&gt;, INDFMINC &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # INDFMPIR &lt;dbl&gt;, RIDEXPRG &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDHRGND &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDHRAGE &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # DMDHRBRN &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDHREDU &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDHRMAR &lt;dbl&gt;, DMDHSEDU &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # SIALANG &lt;dbl&gt;, SIAPROXY &lt;dbl&gt;, SIAINTRP &lt;dbl&gt;, FIALANG &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # FIAPROXY &lt;dbl&gt;, FIAINTRP &lt;dbl&gt;, MIALANG &lt;dbl&gt;, MIAPROXY &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # MIAINTRP &lt;dbl&gt;, AIALANG &lt;dbl&gt;, WTINT2YR &lt;dbl&gt;, WTMEC2YR &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # SDMVPSU &lt;dbl&gt;, SDMVSTRA &lt;dbl&gt;, Gender &lt;dbl&gt;, Age &lt;dbl&gt;, IncomeGroup &lt;chr&gt;, ## # Ethnicity &lt;chr&gt;, Education &lt;dbl&gt;, SMD070 &lt;dbl&gt;, SMQ077 &lt;dbl&gt;, SMD650 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PacksPerDay &lt;dbl&gt;, lbdvid &lt;dbl&gt; Often times SAS datasets have labels associated with the variable names.

This data format is used widely across the internet and in databases. JSON data can represent our usual 2D data or heirarchical data. JSON uses key-value pairs. An example of raw JSON data is given below. { { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Barry Sanders&quot; &quot;games&quot; : 153 &quot;position&quot;: &quot;RB&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Joe Montana&quot; &quot;games&quot;: 192 &quot;position&quot;: &quot;QB&quot; } } There are three major R packages for reading in JSON data: rjson RJSONIO jsonlite We prefer jsonlite. It has many nice features to simplify reading in data, but these features do make the package’s functions a little slower. The most useful functions from jsonlite are summarized below: Function Description fromJSON Reads JSON data from file path or character string. Converts and simplfies to R object toJSON Writes R object to JSON object stream_in Accepts a file connection - can read streaming JSON data 1.3.16 XML XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. This is another data format that is used widely across the internet and in databases. This type of data can again represent our usual 2D data or heirarchical data. XML uss tags &lt; &gt; similar to HTML. An example of raw XML data is given below. &lt;roster&gt; &lt;player&gt; &lt;name&gt;Barry Sanders&lt;/name&gt; &lt;games&gt;153&lt;/games&gt; &lt;position&gt;RB&lt;/position&gt; &lt;/player&gt; &lt;player&gt; &lt;name&gt;Joe Montana&lt;/name&gt; &lt;games&gt;192&lt;/games&gt; &lt;position&gt;QB&lt;/position&gt; &lt;/player&gt; &lt;/roster&gt; The structure of the nodes has parent nodes, child nodes, etc. A basic diagram is given below. Figure 1.1: Source: mysamplecode.com There are two major R packages for reading in XML data: XML xml2 xml2 has all the basic functionality to get data into R. Reading XML data is generally tough since the structure of tags varies by data source! The xml2 core functions are: Function Description read_xml Accepts string, file path, or url argument. Returns XML data object xml_children Returns list of elements downstream from current node xml_parents Returns list of all parent elements from current node xml_contents Returns list of contents from current node as_list Converts XML document or node set to equivalent R list 1.3.17 Databases A database is a collection of data, usually a bunch of 2D tables that have keys that connect them. The Database Management System (DBMS) controls how users interact with the database. There is a common and very useful Structured Query Language (SQL - pronounced ess-que-el or sequel) used by relational database management systems (RDBMS) for retrieving and combining datasets from a database. An example of a relational database structure is given below. Notice there are keys that link different tables. Figure 1.2: Source: oreilly.com There are many popular RDBMS. Some are free and some are proprietary. These are often simply referred to as databases. Oracle - most popular (cross platform) SQL Server - Microsoft product DB2 - IBM product MySQL (open source) - Not as many features but popular PostgreSQL (open source) Again there is a Basic SQL language that is constant across all these database types. The common flow to connect to a database using R is: Connect to the database with DBI::dbConnect() Need appropriate R package for database backend RSQLite::SQLite() for RSQLite RMySQL::MySQL() for RMySQL RPostgreSQL::PostgreSQL() for RPostgreSQL odbc::odbc() for Open Database Connectivity bigrquery::bigquery() for google’s bigQuery con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), host = &quot;hostname.website&quot;, user = &quot;username&quot;, password = rstudioapi::askForPassword(&quot;DB password&quot;) ) Use tbl() to reference a table in the database tbl(con, &quot;name_of_table&quot;) Query the database with SQL or dplyr/dbplyr There is much more about R Studio and Databases here. 1.3.18 APIs API stands for Application Programming Interfaces. This is essentially a defined method for asking for information from a computer. They are useful for getting data or allowing others to run a model you’ve built. There are many open APIs. They usually just require you to register and obtain a key. Once you have a key you simply need to construct the proper URL to return the information you want from the API. As a quick example we will query the Harry Potter database at https://www.potterapi.com/. There is a button on the top right where you can register and obtain a key. The documentation for returning Harry Potter spells states: + All routes need to be prefixed with https://www.potterapi.com/v1/ + GET request: /spells returns all spells + Key goes on the end This tells us how to construct the appropriate URL. The paste and paste0 functions are useful for combining strings (check their help). baseURL &lt;- &quot;https://www.potterapi.com/v1/&quot; value &lt;- &quot;spells?&quot; key &lt;- &quot;key=$2a$10$UMvDCH.93fa2KOjKbJYkOOPMNzdzQpJ0gMnVEtcHzW5Ic04HUmcsa&quot; URL &lt;- paste0(baseURL, value, key) URL ## [1] &quot;https://www.potterapi.com/v1/spells?key=$2a$10$UMvDCH.93fa2KOjKbJYkOOPMNzdzQpJ0gMnVEtcHzW5Ic04HUmcsa&quot; Now we use the RCurl package and the getURL function to ping the URL we just created. This will return the spell data set in JSON form as that is the default response format for this API. spellData &lt;- RCurl::getURL(URL) This is a reasonably large string of information so we can just look at the first 100 characters using the substr function. substr(spellData, 1, 100) ## [1] &quot;[{\\&quot;_id\\&quot;:\\&quot;5b74ebd5fb6fc0739646754c\\&quot;,\\&quot;spell\\&quot;:\\&quot;Aberto\\&quot;,\\&quot;type\\&quot;:\\&quot;Charm\\&quot;,\\&quot;effect\\&quot;:\\&quot;opens objects\\&quot;},{\\&quot;_id\\&quot;:&quot; To convert this to a data frame we can use the fromJSON function in the jsonlite package. tbl_df converts the dataframe to a tibble (for printing purposes). spellDataDF &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(spellData) tbl_df(spellDataDF) ## # A tibble: 151 x 5 ## `_id` spell type effect `__v` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 5b74ebd5fb6fc073964~ Aberto Charm opens objects NA ## 2 5b74ecfa3228320021a~ Accio Charm Summons an object 0 ## 3 5b74ed2f3228320021a~ Age Line Enchantm~ Hides things from younger~ 0 ## 4 5b74ed453228320021a~ Aguamenti Charm shoots water from wand 0 ## 5 5b74ed583228320021a~ Alarte Ascend~ Spell shoots things high in the~ 0 ## # ... with 146 more rows Of course constructing URLs like this yourself isn’t ideal. Languages like python have many packages to help you contact APIs without reading as much documentation. Unfortunately, R does not have a very mature collection of API packages. The article here discusses accessing APIs generically with R. The same website gives a list of APIs that you might consider. 1.3.19 Data Manipulation Ideas As you can see it isn’t too difficult to bring well structured raw data into R. You should now have the basics of reading in delimited, Excel, SAS, SPSS, JSON, and XML data as well as how to connect to a database and contact an API. Once you have your data you may want to manipulate it in some way. Often we want to grab only certain types of observations (filter rows). We also want to only look at only certain variables (select columns). Other times we want to create new variables that may be functions of the data in the data set. When doing data manipulation it is vital to make your work reproducible! Traditionally documentation has been done through comments (# in R) in your R script. This is being replaced by using a ‘Notebook’ environment like R Markdown. 1.3.20 Documenting with Markdown You may have heard of JUPYTER notebooks. This is a program that allows you to weave plain text with formatting characters along side code. JUPYTER allows you to call Julia, Python, R, or SAS code (among others). R Markdown is a built in notebook for R studio! A nice intro video is available here. R Markdown is designed to be used in three ways (R for Data Science): Communicating to decision makers (focus on conclusions not code) Collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!) As environment to do data science (documents what you did and what you were thinking) Most have heard of HTML or HyperText Mark-up Language. This is really just plain text that a web browser like firefox interprets and renders. Markdown is a specific markup language that has easier syntax but is not as powerful. Any plain text file can be used although the .Rmd extension associates the file with R Studio. RStudio makes it easy to create a Markdown document. You can create many commonly used types of output including HTML, PDF, Word, and HTML slides. An R Markdown file contains three important types of content: (Optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s Chunks of R code Text mixed with simple text formatting instructions The YAML header defines settings for document: --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; author: &quot;First Last&quot; date: &quot;xxxx&quot; output: html_document --- The hot key combination of CTRL/CMD + Shift + k ‘knits’ (or creates the output type) via this information. Code Chunks can contain any R code. These can be started by typing ```{r} out or with CTRL/CMD + Alt + I. This code will be executed when document is created and the chunks will be evaulated sequentially. Options can be specified on individual code chunks to hide their code or output (among other things). Below you’ll see plain text with markdown sytnax included: ##R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see &lt;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&gt;. When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. When the file is created ## becomes a header, “&lt;…&gt;” a link, and **Knit** bold font. You can learn much more about how to use R Markdown with this handy cheat sheet. The key idea here is that you can easily write down your thought process and document all of the changes you make to your data. This creates a reproducible final product! 1.3.21 Logical Statements Our current goal is to subset rows or columns of a dataset. To do this efficiently we need to learn about logical statements. A logical statement is a comparison that resolves as TRUE or FALSE. R has all of the standard comparison operators: == equal to != not equal to &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;= less than (or equal) and greater than (or equal) &quot;hi&quot; == &quot; hi&quot; #== is comparison ## [1] FALSE &quot;hi&quot; == &quot;hi&quot; ## [1] TRUE 4 &gt;= 1 ## [1] TRUE 4 != 1 ## [1] TRUE Sometimes we see issues due to a loss of precision when doing mathematical operations. sqrt(3)^2 == 3 ## [1] FALSE The near function from the dplyr package can help with this type of situation. dplyr::near(sqrt(3)^2, 3) ## [1] TRUE Another common way to do a logical statement in R is to use an is. family function. is.numeric(&quot;Word&quot;) ## [1] FALSE is.numeric(10) ## [1] TRUE is.character(&quot;10&quot;) ## [1] TRUE is.na(c(1:2, NA, 3)) ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE is.matrix(c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;)) ## [1] FALSE How do we use logical statements to subset our data? Logical vectors can be used for indexing an R object. The concept is: Feed index a vector of TRUE/FALSE or 0/1 values R will return elements where TRUE or 1 occurred Let’s subset the built-in iris data set. First we’ll convert it to a tibble so it prints nicely. iris &lt;- tbl_df(iris) iris Now, we can create an indexing vector corresponding to some condition of interest. For instance, we may want to only look at the Species ‘setosa’ flowers. iris$Species == &quot;setosa&quot; #vector indicating setosa values ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [13] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [25] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [37] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [49] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [61] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [73] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [85] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [97] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 50 entries ] Now we can feed this in as our row index to the [ function. Remember for rectangular data the first index you give refers to the rows and the second to columns. iris[iris$Species == &quot;setosa&quot;, ] ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa ## 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 8 5.0 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 9 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 10 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa ## 11 5.4 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 12 4.8 3.4 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 13 4.8 3.0 1.4 0.1 setosa ## 14 4.3 3.0 1.1 0.1 setosa ## 15 5.8 4.0 1.2 0.2 setosa ## 16 5.7 4.4 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 17 5.4 3.9 1.3 0.4 setosa ## 18 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 19 5.7 3.8 1.7 0.3 setosa ## 20 5.1 3.8 1.5 0.3 setosa ## [ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 30 rows ] Rather than use [, a base R function called subset can be used. subset(iris, Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa ## 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 8 5.0 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 9 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 10 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa ## 11 5.4 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 12 4.8 3.4 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 13 4.8 3.0 1.4 0.1 setosa ## 14 4.3 3.0 1.1 0.1 setosa ## 15 5.8 4.0 1.2 0.2 setosa ## 16 5.7 4.4 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 17 5.4 3.9 1.3 0.4 setosa ## 18 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 19 5.7 3.8 1.7 0.3 setosa ## 20 5.1 3.8 1.5 0.3 setosa ## [ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 30 rows ] This function works quite well but we want to work in the tidyverse. The filter function from the dplyr package (installed with tidyverse) will be our function of choice. For filter the first argument is the data frame (or tibble) and the second is the logical statement used for indexing the rows. filter(iris, Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa ## 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 8 5.0 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 9 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 10 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa ## 11 5.4 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 12 4.8 3.4 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 13 4.8 3.0 1.4 0.1 setosa ## 14 4.3 3.0 1.1 0.1 setosa ## 15 5.8 4.0 1.2 0.2 setosa ## 16 5.7 4.4 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 17 5.4 3.9 1.3 0.4 setosa ## 18 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 19 5.7 3.8 1.7 0.3 setosa ## 20 5.1 3.8 1.5 0.3 setosa ## [ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 30 rows ] Often we’ll want to subset based on more than one condition. These can be created using standard logical operators. In R these are: &amp; ‘and’ | ‘or’ Operator A,B true A true, B false A,B false &amp; A &amp; B = TRUE A &amp; B = FALSE A &amp; B = FALSE | A | B = TRUE A | B = TRUE A | B = FALSE For the most part we’ll want to use the single &amp; or |. &amp;&amp; and || are alternatives that only look at only first comparison done (if given a vector of comparisons). A quick example of the compound logical syntax is given below. Parenthesis are not necessary but are quite useful to keep things straight! Here we generate 10 random values between 0 and 1 (set.seed just starts the random number generator at a specific spot so we can get the same 10 values each time we create this document!). We use | to return TRUE if the randomly generated value is either below 0.25 or above 0.75. set.seed(3) x &lt;- runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 1) x ## [1] 0.1680415 0.8075164 0.3849424 0.3277343 0.6021007 0.6043941 0.1246334 ## [8] 0.2946009 0.5776099 0.6309793 (x &lt; 0.25) | (x &gt; 0.75) ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE With this kind of syntax we can now create an indexing vector to only pull out large petal setosa flowers: (iris$Petal.Length &gt; 1.5) &amp; (iris$Petal.Width &gt; 0.3) &amp; (iris$Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [25] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [37] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [49] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [61] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [73] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [85] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [97] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 50 entries ] Using this in the filter function we return only a few observations corresponding to our condition. filter(iris, (Petal.Length &gt; 1.5) &amp; (Petal.Width &gt; 0.3) &amp; (Species == &quot;setosa&quot;)) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa ## 2 5.1 3.3 1.7 0.5 setosa ## 3 5.0 3.4 1.6 0.4 setosa ## 4 5.0 3.5 1.6 0.6 setosa ## 5 5.1 3.8 1.9 0.4 setosa 1.3.22 dplyr The tidyverse has many useful packages for common data manipulation tasks. Make sure library(tidyverse) has been run when working through this section! Two major packages for data manipulation are: -dplry package made for most standard data manipulation tasks tidyr package reshapes data (wide and long format, split columns, etc) This section focuses on the most useful functions from the dplyr package: tbl_df() - convert data frame to one with better printing filter() - subset rows arrange() - reorder rows select() - subset columns rename() - rename columns Later we’ll look at mutate() - add newly created column transmute() - create new variable group_by() - group rows by a variable summarise() - apply basic function to data One really nice thing about the functions in the tidyverse is that the syntax is mostly consistent (save ggplot2). The basic syntax is function(tibble, actions, ...) Let’s get started! We’ve seen tbl_df a few times. This function converts a data frame to one with better printing and no simplification. To use it we can simply ‘wrap’ data frame with it. In this section we’ll do examples on datasets from the Lahman pacakge. This package has data about baseball players dating back from the start of professional baseball. #install.packages(&quot;Lahman&quot;) library(Lahman) ## Warning: package &#39;Lahman&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2 #old method for previewing a dataset head(Batting, n = 4) #look at just first 4 observations ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR RBI SB CS BB SO ## 1 abercda01 1871 1 TRO NA 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 addybo01 1871 1 RC1 NA 25 118 30 32 6 0 0 13 8 1 4 0 ## 3 allisar01 1871 1 CL1 NA 29 137 28 40 4 5 0 19 3 1 2 5 ## 4 allisdo01 1871 1 WS3 NA 27 133 28 44 10 2 2 27 1 1 0 2 ## IBB HBP SH SF GIDP ## 1 NA NA NA NA 0 ## 2 NA NA NA NA 0 ## 3 NA NA NA NA 1 ## 4 NA NA NA NA 0 Batting &lt;- tbl_df(Batting) Batting ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 abercda~ 1871 1 TRO NA 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 addybo01 1871 1 RC1 NA 25 118 30 32 6 0 0 ## 3 allisar~ 1871 1 CL1 NA 29 137 28 40 4 5 0 ## 4 allisdo~ 1871 1 WS3 NA 27 133 28 44 10 2 2 ## 5 ansonca~ 1871 1 RC1 NA 25 120 29 39 11 3 0 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; If the data has been read in with haven, readxl, or readr, it is probably in this format already! 1.3.22.1 Row Manipulations Again, we may to do a subset based on the rows of our dataset. We just looked at using the filter function to subset rows or observations of a dataset. Let’s look at a few more examples. We may only want to return observations from the Batting dataset corresponding to the Pittsburgh Pirates (PIT). filter(Batting, teamID == &quot;PIT&quot;) ## # A tibble: 4,817 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 barklsa~ 1887 1 PIT NL 89 340 44 76 10 4 1 ## 2 beeched~ 1887 1 PIT NL 41 169 15 41 8 0 2 ## 3 bishobi~ 1887 1 PIT NL 3 9 0 0 0 0 0 ## 4 brownto~ 1887 1 PIT NL 47 192 30 47 3 4 0 ## 5 carrofr~ 1887 1 PIT NL 102 421 71 138 24 15 6 ## # ... with 4,812 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; We could use a compound logical to only return Pirate data from the year 2000. filter(Batting, teamID == &quot;PIT&quot; &amp; yearID == 2000) ## # A tibble: 46 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 anderji~ 2000 1 PIT NL 27 50 5 7 1 0 0 ## 2 arroybr~ 2000 1 PIT NL 21 21 2 3 2 0 0 ## 3 avenbr01 2000 1 PIT NL 72 148 18 37 11 0 5 ## 4 benjami~ 2000 1 PIT NL 93 233 28 63 18 2 2 ## 5 bensokr~ 2000 1 PIT NL 32 65 3 6 2 0 0 ## # ... with 41 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, CS &lt;int&gt;, ## # BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, GIDP &lt;int&gt; Another useful row operation is to rearrange the data based on some criteria. The arrange function allows us to sort a data set by numeric or character variables. For instance we could reorder alphabetically by the teamID variable. arrange(Batting, teamID) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 berrych~ 1884 1 ALT UA 7 25 2 6 0 0 0 ## 2 brownji~ 1884 1 ALT UA 21 88 12 22 2 2 1 ## 3 carropa~ 1884 1 ALT UA 11 49 4 13 1 0 0 ## 4 connojo~ 1884 1 ALT UA 3 11 0 1 0 0 0 ## 5 crosscl~ 1884 1 ALT UA 2 7 1 4 1 0 0 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; A secondary arrangement can be done as well (and third, etc.) arrange(Batting, teamID, G) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 daisege~ 1884 1 ALT UA 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 crosscl~ 1884 1 ALT UA 2 7 1 4 1 0 0 ## 3 manloch~ 1884 1 ALT UA 2 7 1 3 0 0 0 ## 4 connojo~ 1884 1 ALT UA 3 11 0 1 0 0 0 ## 5 shafff01 1884 1 ALT UA 6 19 1 3 0 0 0 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; The arrangement can be done descending as well by giving the column (variable) with desc. arrange(Batting, teamID, desc(G)) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 smithge~ 1884 1 ALT UA 25 108 9 34 8 1 0 ## 2 harrifr~ 1884 1 ALT UA 24 95 10 25 2 1 0 ## 3 doughch~ 1884 1 ALT UA 23 85 6 22 5 0 0 ## 4 murphjo~ 1884 1 ALT UA 23 94 10 14 1 0 0 ## 5 brownji~ 1884 1 ALT UA 21 88 12 22 2 2 1 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; 1.3.22.2 Column Manipulations We may want to look at only certain variables (select columns). The select function from the dplyr package allows us to choose columns of interest. We’ve seen the use of $ and [ , ] to do this already but select offers many advantages. Same syntax as tidyverse functions Useful ways to use character matching to select columns Let’s see it in action! To choose a single column of interest just supply the column name (or position) after the tibble. select(Batting, X2B) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 1 ## X2B ## &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 ## 2 6 ## 3 4 ## 4 10 ## 5 11 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows Multiple columns can be selected by giving multiple column names. select(Batting, playerID, X2B) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 2 ## playerID X2B ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 abercda01 0 ## 2 addybo01 6 ## 3 allisar01 4 ## 4 allisdo01 10 ## 5 ansonca01 11 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows There are many ways to select multiple columsn (variables). For instance, contiguous columns can be selected using the :. #all columns between select(Batting, X2B:HR) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 3 ## X2B X3B HR ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 0 ## 2 6 0 0 ## 3 4 5 0 ## 4 10 2 2 ## 5 11 3 0 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows Character matching can be done to select all columns that contain a certain character. #all columns containing select(Batting, contains(&quot;X&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 2 ## X2B X3B ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 ## 2 6 0 ## 3 4 5 ## 4 10 2 ## 5 11 3 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows Similary, there is a starts_with and ends_with function. #all columns starting with select(Batting, starts_with(&quot;X&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 2 ## X2B X3B ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 ## 2 6 0 ## 3 4 5 ## 4 10 2 ## 5 11 3 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows #multiple selections select(Batting, starts_with(&quot;X&quot;), ends_with(&quot;ID&quot;), G) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 7 ## X2B X3B playerID yearID teamID lgID G ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 abercda01 1871 TRO NA 1 ## 2 6 0 addybo01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## 3 4 5 allisar01 1871 CL1 NA 29 ## 4 10 2 allisdo01 1871 WS3 NA 27 ## 5 11 3 ansonca01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows Sometimes we want to rename variables. This can be done with the rename function. #rename our previous selection rename(select(Batting, starts_with(&quot;X&quot;), ends_with(&quot;ID&quot;), G), &quot;Doubles&quot; = X2B, &quot;Triples&quot; = X3B) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 7 ## Doubles Triples playerID yearID teamID lgID G ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 abercda01 1871 TRO NA 1 ## 2 6 0 addybo01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## 3 4 5 allisar01 1871 CL1 NA 29 ## 4 10 2 allisdo01 1871 WS3 NA 27 ## 5 11 3 ansonca01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows You may notice this is kind function nesting makes this code difficult for humans to parse. Piping or Chaining can be used to make the use of multiple functions easier! %&gt;% is the piping operator. Generically, piping does the following x %&gt;% f(y) turns into f(x,y) x %&gt;% f(y) %&gt;% g(z) turns into g(f(x, y), z) Since the tidyverse functions all have the same syntax, piping works wonders for readability! Piping can be used with functions outside the tidyverse if this structure works. Let’s rewrite our previous nested function with piping. When reading code with piping, read %&gt;% as the word ‘then.’ Batting data set (then) select these columns (then) rename the variables. Batting %&gt;% select(starts_with(&quot;X&quot;), ends_with(&quot;ID&quot;), G) %&gt;% rename(&quot;Doubles&quot; = X2B, &quot;Triples&quot; = X3B) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 7 ## Doubles Triples playerID yearID teamID lgID G ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 abercda01 1871 TRO NA 1 ## 2 6 0 addybo01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## 3 4 5 allisar01 1871 CL1 NA 29 ## 4 10 2 allisdo01 1871 WS3 NA 27 ## 5 11 3 ansonca01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows We may also wish to reorder our columns (variables). This can be done using select. The everything function is handy so you don’t have to list all the variables out if you only want to reorder a few. Batting %&gt;% select(playerID, HR, everything()) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 22 ## playerID HR yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 abercda~ 0 1871 1 TRO NA 1 4 0 0 0 0 ## 2 addybo01 0 1871 1 RC1 NA 25 118 30 32 6 0 ## 3 allisar~ 0 1871 1 CL1 NA 29 137 28 40 4 5 ## 4 allisdo~ 2 1871 1 WS3 NA 27 133 28 44 10 2 ## 5 ansonca~ 0 1871 1 RC1 NA 25 120 29 39 11 3 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; Another commonly done column manipulation is the creating of new variables. Given a data frame and an appropriate length vector (new variable) we can use cbind (column bind) to add the variable to the data frame. temp &lt;- cbind(iris, extra = rep(&quot;a&quot;, 150)) str(temp) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 150 obs. of 6 variables: ## $ Sepal.Length: num 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ... ## $ Sepal.Width : num 3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ... ## $ Petal.Length: num 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ... ## $ Petal.Width : num 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ... ## $ Species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ extra : Factor w/ 1 level &quot;a&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... More simply we can just add the new variable as a named (list) element! iris$extra &lt;- rep(&quot;a&quot;, 150) str(iris) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 150 obs. of 6 variables: ## $ Sepal.Length: num 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ... ## $ Sepal.Width : num 3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ... ## $ Petal.Length: num 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ... ## $ Petal.Width : num 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ... ## $ Species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ extra : chr &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; ... To stay in the tidyverse and add more functionality we can use two functions from dplyr: mutate() - add newly created column(s) to current data frame transmute() - create new data frame with created variable(s) The syntax for these functions is similar to previous. We simply name the new variables after specifying our data set. mutate(data, newVarName = functionOfData, newVarName2 = functionOfData, ...)

The syntax for the for loop is for(index in values){ code to be run } The index defines the ‘counter’ or variable that varies as the loop iterates and ‘values’ define which values the index takes on. for (i in 1:10){ print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 ## [1] 6 ## [1] 7 ## [1] 8 ## [1] 9 ## [1] 10 for (index in c(&quot;cat&quot;,&quot;hat&quot;,&quot;worm&quot;)){ print(index) } ## [1] &quot;cat&quot; ## [1] &quot;hat&quot; ## [1] &quot;worm&quot; If we want to code our wind variable we could run a for loop with if logic inside: status&lt;-vector() #initialize vector to save results for (i in 1:nrow(airquality)){ if(airquality$Wind[i] &gt;= 15){ status[i] &lt;- &quot;HighWind&quot; } else if (airquality$Wind[i] &gt;= 10){ status[i] &lt;- &quot;Windy&quot; } else if (airquality$Wind[i] &gt;= 6){ status[i] &lt;- &quot;LightWind&quot; } else if (airquality$Wind[i] &gt;= 0){ status[i] &lt;- &quot;Calm&quot; } else { status[i] &lt;- &quot;Error&quot; } } Then we can append the new variable to our dataset. airquality$status &lt;- status airquality$status ## [1] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [7] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [13] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; ## [19] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [25] &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [31] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [37] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [43] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; ## [49] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [55] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [61] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [67] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [73] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [79] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [85] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [91] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [97] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 53 entries ] This works just fine! Some other things to be aware of with loops: break kicks you out of the loop for (i in 1:5){ if (i == 3){ break } print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 next jumps to the next iteration of the loop for (i in 1:5){ if (i == 3){ next } print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 while loop are similar while(condition) { expression to evaluate modify condition? } The main issue with loops in R is that they are inefficient. R is an interpreted language so it must figure out how to evaluate code at each iteration of loop, slowing it down. Vectorized functions are much faster! These functions work on an entire vector at once so R doesn’t have to figure things out as often. ifelse() is a vectorized version of if then else. The syntax is: ifelse(vector_condition, if_true_do_this, if_false_do_this) Now to create our Wind status variable we can nest ifelse statements. ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 15, &quot;HighWind&quot;, ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 10, &quot;Windy&quot;, ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 6, &quot;LightWind&quot;, &quot;Calm&quot;))) ## [1] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [7] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [13] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; ## [19] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [25] &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [31] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [37] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [43] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; ## [49] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [55] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [61] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [67] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [73] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [79] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [85] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [91] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [97] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 53 entries ] ifelse can also easily be used with transmute() or mutate()! mutate(airquality, status = ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 15, &quot;HighWind&quot;, ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 10, &quot;Windy&quot;, ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 6, &quot;LightWind&quot;, &quot;Calm&quot;))) ) ## # A tibble: 153 x 7 ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day status ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 LightWind ## 2 36 118 8 72 5 2 LightWind ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 Windy ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 Windy ## 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 Windy ## # ... with 148 more rows Note: the cut function can also be used to categorize a numeric variable pretty easily. This covers the major uses of dplyr for manipulating rows and columns. dplyr also has great functionality for doing joins similar to SQL. We’ll also see how it can be used to create basic numeric summaries using group_by and summarize. The cheat sheet is a great reference! Recap of basic commands: tbl_df - convert data frame to one with better printing filter - subset rows arrange - reorder rows select - subset columns rename - reorder columns mutate/transmute - create new variable 1.3.23 Reshaping Data We’ve talked about rows being observations and columns being variables. This is generally how most statistical analysis software likes their data to be formatted. This is called ‘long’ format data - each row is an observation. Sometimes data doesn’t come that way! Data may have observations across some columns since viewing data is often more natural that way. For example, consider the weather data set below. tempsData &lt;- read_table2(file = &quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/cityTemps.txt&quot;) tempsData ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## city = col_character(), ## sun = col_double(), ## mon = col_double(), ## tue = col_double(), ## wed = col_double(), ## thr = col_double(), ## fri = col_double(), ## sat = col_double() ## ) ## # A tibble: 6 x 8 ## city sun mon tue wed thr fri sat ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 atlanta 81 87 83 79 88 91 94 ## 2 baltimore 73 75 70 78 73 75 79 ## 3 charlotte 82 80 75 82 83 88 93 ## 4 denver 72 71 67 68 72 71 58 ## 5 ellington 51 42 47 52 55 56 59 ## 6 frankfort 70 70 72 70 74 74 79 This data set is said to be in ‘wide’ format because columns represent observations. For most analyses this type of data will need to be reshaped into long format. The tidyr package can be used for this purpose! The gather function takes multiple columns and gathers them into key-value pairs. This tkes wide data and makes it long. Similarly there is a spread function takes two columns (key &amp; value) and spreads in to multiple columns. This takes long data and makes it wide. Let’s switch the tempsData dataset to ‘long’ form with gather(). We need to identify the key = new name for values in columns value = new name for data values columns describe which columns to take tempsData %&gt;% gather(key = day, value = temp, 2:8) ## # A tibble: 42 x 3 ## city day temp ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 atlanta sun 81 ## 2 baltimore sun 73 ## 3 charlotte sun 82 ## 4 denver sun 72 ## 5 ellington sun 51 ## # ... with 37 more rows The columns can be provided to gather in similar ways to how we chose them in the select function. newTempsData &lt;- tempsData %&gt;% gather(key = day, value = temp, sun:sat) newTempsData ## # A tibble: 42 x 3 ## city day temp ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 atlanta sun 81 ## 2 baltimore sun 73 ## 3 charlotte sun 82 ## 4 denver sun 72 ## 5 ellington sun 51 ## # ... with 37 more rows To give an example of using spread we can take our long format data and turn it back into wide format. WE just need to identify the: key = new column names value = value to spread out newTempsData %&gt;% spread(key = day, value = temp) ## # A tibble: 6 x 8 ## city fri mon sat sun thr tue wed ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 atlanta 91 87 94 81 88 83 79 ## 2 baltimore 75 75 79 73 73 70 78 ## 3 charlotte 88 80 93 82 83 75 82 ## 4 denver 71 71 58 72 72 67 68 ## 5 ellington 56 42 59 51 55 47 52 ## 6 frankfort 74 70 79 70 74 72 70 The tidyr package also has useful functions for separating a column (or combining two columns) using separate (and unite) Consider a data set on air pollution in Chicago. chicagoData &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/Chicago.csv&quot;) chicagoData ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## X = col_double(), ## city = col_character(), ## date = col_character(), ## death = col_double(), ## temp = col_double(), ## dewpoint = col_double(), ## pm10 = col_double(), ## o3 = col_double(), ## time = col_double(), ## season = col_character(), ## year = col_double() ## ) ## # A tibble: 1,461 x 11 ## X city date death temp dewpoint pm10 o3 time season year ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3654 chic 1/1/1997 137 36 37.5 13.1 5.66 3654 winter 1997 ## 2 3655 chic 1/2/1997 123 45 47.2 41.9 5.53 3655 winter 1997 ## 3 3656 chic 1/3/1997 127 40 38 27.0 6.29 3656 winter 1997 ## 4 3657 chic 1/4/1997 146 51.5 45.5 25.1 7.54 3657 winter 1997 ## 5 3658 chic 1/5/1997 102 27 11.2 15.3 20.8 3658 winter 1997 ## # ... with 1,456 more rows The lubridate package great for date data but let’s just do some basic parsing of the date variable using separate. We can split the date variable by the / that separates the day, month, and year to create three new columns. Using remove = FALSE keeps the original variable (date) and convert = TRUE attempts to convert the newly created variables to numeric if possible. chicagoData %&gt;% separate(date, c(&quot;Day&quot;, &quot;Month&quot;, &quot;Year&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;, convert = TRUE, remove = FALSE) ## # A tibble: 1,461 x 14 ## X city date Day Month Year death temp dewpoint pm10 o3 time ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3654 chic 1/1/~ 1 1 1997 137 36 37.5 13.1 5.66 3654 ## 2 3655 chic 1/2/~ 1 2 1997 123 45 47.2 41.9 5.53 3655 ## 3 3656 chic 1/3/~ 1 3 1997 127 40 38 27.0 6.29 3656 ## 4 3657 chic 1/4/~ 1 4 1997 146 51.5 45.5 25.1 7.54 3657 ## 5 3658 chic 1/5/~ 1 5 1997 102 27 11.2 15.3 20.8 3658 ## # ... with 1,456 more rows, and 2 more variables: season &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt; Similarly we can combine columns with unite. Let’s create a new column that is just the day and month separated by a -. chicagoData %&gt;% separate(date, c(&quot;Day&quot;, &quot;Month&quot;, &quot;Year&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;, convert = TRUE, remove = FALSE) %&gt;% unite(DayMonth, Day, Month, sep = &quot;-&quot;) ## # A tibble: 1,461 x 13 ## X city date DayMonth Year death temp dewpoint pm10 o3 time season ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 3654 chic 1/1/~ 1-1 1997 137 36 37.5 13.1 5.66 3654 winter ## 2 3655 chic 1/2/~ 1-2 1997 123 45 47.2 41.9 5.53 3655 winter ## 3 3656 chic 1/3/~ 1-3 1997 127 40 38 27.0 6.29 3656 winter ## 4 3657 chic 1/4/~ 1-4 1997 146 51.5 45.5 25.1 7.54 3657 winter ## 5 3658 chic 1/5/~ 1-5 1997 102 27 11.2 15.3 20.8 3658 winter ## # ... with 1,456 more rows, and 1 more variable: year &lt;dbl&gt; You should now be ready to use R to get data in and do some basic manipulation! 1.4 SAS The general workflow for programming in SAS is similar to that of R. First raw data must be imported to SAS. Once that data is imported you will find an appropriate PROC (or procedure) that will summarize or analyze your data appropriate. Often times relevant graphs and summaries are created with a single PROC. At the end of this section the reader should be able to do the following: install SAS University Edition read and write basic SAS programs import well-formatted data into SAS do basic data manipulation in SAS As the book progresses the steps of summarizing and analyzing the data will be covered. Let’s get started! 1.4.1 Basics of SAS 1.4.2 Reading Data with SAS 1.4.3 Manipulating Data with SAS "],
["sampling-experiments-and-exploratory-data-analysis.html", "Chapter 2 Sampling, Experiments, and Exploratory Data Analysis 2.1 Data in the Wild 2.2 Descriptive Study - Farmer’s Market 2.3 Statistical Testing Ideas - Simulated Experiment 2.4 Statistical Ideas and Concepts 2.5 Software", " Chapter 2 Sampling, Experiments, and Exploratory Data Analysis 2.1 Data in the Wild Data is a collection of information about a group, which may include both quantitative and qualitative variables. Data is ubiquitous in today’s society. Healthcare, marketing, history, biology, … basically, every field has a quantitative aspect. However, the quality of data varies greatly from study to study and this implies the conclusions which you can draw from a study vary as well. 2.1.1 Data from Experiments Some data comes from a well-designed experiment where a researcher uses sound principles to select units and conduct interventions. For example, a mechanical engineer wants to determine which variables influence the overall gas mileage of a certain year and model of a car. Gas mileage would be referred to as the response variable for this study. After careful consideration, the engineer chooses to investigate a few explanatory variables. They looked at the following factors that they believed may affect the overall gas mileage: Tire pressure (low, standard) Octane rating of fuel (regular, midgrade, premium) Type of driving (defensive, aggressive) They also choose to control or hold constant the following variables during the implementation of the study: Weather conditions Route Tire type Past car usage The engineer randomly selects 24 cars from the assembly line for that year and model of car (we’ll learn more about the importance of selecting a representative sample of cars shortly). Software is used to randomly assign a treatment or combination of the factors to each car of the 24 cars. For instance, low tire pressure, regular octane fuel, and defensive driving would be a treatment. The cars would be called the experimental units or (EUs) as they are the unit the treatments are assigned to. The experiment is run and the gas mileage found for each car. As the car is being measured we’d refer to the car as the observational unit. This short description exhibits three important concepts in experimental design that we’ll come back to many times. Experimental Study - researchers manipulate the conditions in which the study is done. Pillars of experimental design: (Put an outer block around this) Randomization - treatments are randomly assigned to the experimental units Replication - multiple (independent) experimental units are assigned the same treatment Control - study conditions are held constant where possible to reduce variability in the response 2.1.2 Data from Observational Studies Some data comes from an observational study where the researcher collects data without imposing any changes. For example, an economist wants to investigate the effects of recently added tariffs on agricultural products to the amount and value of such products that are traded between the United States and Asia. This study would have two response variables, the amount and value of each product traded between the two parties. In order to take into account season variation and time of year, the economist decides to compare the two response variables from the current year - 6 months worth of data - to the average values of the two response variables during the same 6 month periods for the past 5 years. We would refer to the time frame of the data as an explanatory variable. This time frame could be labeled to take on one of two values: no-tariff (past) or tariff (current). The researcher obtains the data from the census bureau and conducts their analysis. Notice that the researcher, while certainly being actively involved in the careful consideration of the data to be collected, does not actively intervene or impose a change. This is the key component of an observational study. Observational Study - researchers collect data without imposing any changes on the study environment. 2.1.3 Observational vs Experimental You may have noticed that both types of studies have some things in common. For instance, both studies have response (??? so I was thinking about maybe bolding most stats words as we go to point them out to students… thoughts???) variables that characterize the performance of the study in some sense. Importantly, these response variables have variation. That is, observing the variable is non-deterministic even under identical situations. There are also explanatory variables that the researcher is interested in with regard to their relationship with the response variable. Beyond that, both studies hope to make conclusions about a larger group using data. This is the idea of statistical inference (??? Do we want to talk about the differences between prediction and inference here? - later???). More formally the group of values, items, or individuals defines the the population of interest and the data collected represents the sample. For the gas mileage example, the population would be all cars of the year and make in question and the sample would be the data on the 24 cars. For the tariff example, the population would be a conceptual population of all future agricultural products traded between the United States and Asia and the sample would be the information from the six years of trade data. Population - (Possibly conceptual) group of units of interest Sample - Subset of the population on which we observe data Statistical Inference - Process of using sample data to make statements or claims about a population (???Usually with the goal of determining which variables are important for a response???) Both of these studies had to determine how to obtain their observations. For the experiment, 24 cars were used. For the observational study, six years of data were collected. How this data is collected can be extremely important in terms of the types of conclusions that can be made. Data needs to be unbiased and representative of the population in which the researcher hopes to make inference otherwise the conclusions made are likely invalid. We’ll discuss the idea of what makes a good and bad sampling scheme later. The major difference between the two studies was the active (experimental) and passive (observational) roles played by the researcher. This difference is also of vital importance to the types of conclusions that can be made from the study. A well-designed experiment can often infer causation to the treatments where an observational study cannot. The conclusions a researcher can make based on how the data were collected and the type of study are outlined in the table below. (??? Probably just remake this table ourselves with our own words. This isn’t exactly ‘their’ original thought or something we need to attribute. ???) Figure 2.1: Scope of Inference, cite: Khan Academy Doing an observational study doesn’t mean that your study is bad! An observational study is sometimes done out of necessity when an experiment wouldn’t be ethical or feasible. For the tariff example, there really isn’t a way to conduct an experiment. If we wanted to design an experiment to see if smoking causes lung cancer, that would be unethical because we can’t force people to smoke. The key point is that the implications we can draw will differ greatly between experimental and observational studies and will depend heavily on the quality (in relation to the population) of the data you have. 2.1.4 The Role of Statistics Statistics is the science of learning from data. It encompasses the collection of data, the design of an experiment, the summarization of data, and the modeling or analysis used in order to make a decision or further scientific knowledge. (???I feel like this definition doesn’t quite get the sampling part right or maybe the holistic process or something - update as needed! JP???) (This will be changed to a different style of callout - maybe “note”?) Statistics in everyday use usually refers to simply summaries about data (means/averages, proportions, or counts). Statistics as a field encompasses a much larger range of ideas including how to collect data, model data, and make decisions or come to conclusions when faced with uncertainty. Statistical methods are needed because data is variable. If we again collected data about the gas mileage of vehicles under the exact same study conditions we’ll get slightly different results. If we observed another six month period of trade data we’ll see different amounts and values. Accounting for this variability in data is a key component of a statistical analysis. Generally, one should try to take a holistic view of a study. Before any data is collected it is vital to understand the goals and background of the study. These will inform the data you ideally want to collect as well as the data that you are able to collect - which may need to act as a proxy. A plan should be determined for the actual collection and storing of the data. The entire study design will then inform the statistical analysis and conclusions that can be drawn. Taking this bigger picture view of the problem, we can usually follow these steps (we’ll try to follow these throughout the book!): Define the objective of the experiment and understand the background (Define Objective &amp; Background) Select appropriate response variables (Select Response) Identify sources of variation (Determine Sources of Variation) Choose sampling scheme and/or experimental design (Select Design) Carry out the study (Do Study) Statistically analyze the data (Do Statistical Analysis) Draw conclusions from the analysis while considering limitations and the steps above as well as communicate results (Draw Conclusions &amp; Communicate) We’ll focus on this entire process in our big chapter examples and mostly investigate designed experiments. We attempt to tackle each topic in this text with a problem-based approach. That is, we identify a real-world problem and discuss the relevant statistical ideas in context. At the end of each chapter, we provide a recap of the main statistical ideas and discuss other important related topics. Where applicable we include a section that outlines some of the mathematical concepts as well as a section to outline software related to the topic. 2.2 Descriptive Study - Farmer’s Market 2.2.1 Define Objective &amp; Background A nutrition scientist wanted to understand the cleanliness and food hygiene of the vendors at the North Carolina State Farmer’s Market (henceforth the farmer’s market). Secondarily, she wanted to learn about vendor sales to see if there was a relationship with their cleanliness and food hygiene. The researcher had access to the names of each vendor’s business, their general purpose, and the products they sold. The researcher needed to decide the scope of their study. Formally, they needed to define the population of interest. The population is the group of people or units of interest to the researcher. As her interest centered around food-related businesses, she restricted to looking at the vendors which sold horticultural crops. She hoped that conclusions made by her study could apply to all horticulture vendors at the farmer’s market - thus, this is her population. Note: One could try to do a study at just the North Carolina State Farmer’s Market and extend the results to all farmer’s markets in the state or in the south, but that would require many assumptions to be valid. A list of the horticultural products sold and their is availability is reproduced below. 2.2.2 Select Response The researcher needed to determine the variables to collect that would best help to answer their questions of interest. These variables that characterize the experiment are called response or target variables. To investigate the knowledge of hygiene and safety, a short questionnaire was developed to allow the vendor’s head manager (or similar employee) to describe their safety protocol and knowledge: For your produce with signs that say “clean” or “washed”, what does this mean? How are the foods transported to the market? eg: refrigerated/closed storage What food safety risks do you as a vendor worry about? Do you require one-use gloves to be used? (Yes or No) Do you designate a person in charge of money transactions? (Yes or No) The researcher also planned to do an assessment of the cleanliness of each vendor’s station at different times. Her team would pick 30 days during the summer in which they’d walk through the vendor stations and collect the following information: Overall is the station clean (Yes or No) Is anyone smoking around the food products? (Yes or No) Are tables covered? (Yes or No) If so, what is the material? Do employees appear to be clean? (Yes or No) Are one-use gloves used? (Yes or No) Is there a designated person in charge of money transactions (Yes or No) She noted that there is a yearly cycle to the products sold and decided to collect vendors sales information by looking at the (AMT) amount sold in the last year (in dollars), the (PURCHASE) total number of purchases made in the last year, and the (NUM_ITEMS) total number of items sold in the last year. For the last variable, they had to decide how to measure the number of items sold for the different types of crops. For most of the crops looking at the total weight (in lbs) sold made sense. But, for some, other measures were needed. For example, for sweet corn the number of ears sold would be recorded. You can see that there are many decisions that the researcher must make in simply deciding the response variables to collect! A poor choice here can make or break a study. 2.2.3 Determine Sources of Variation The response variables clearly have some relationship to other variables that could be collected. For instance, the NUM_ITEMS variable is clearly going to be different based upon what crops the vendor sells. The AMT variable would differ depending on the size of the vendor’s inventory. These are examples of explanatory variables or variables that define the study conditions. Explanatory variables go by many names such as predictors, features, or independent variables. A main consideration about whether or not to record a variable is whether or not the variable would be related to a variation in a response variable. Since the response variables are truly what is of interest, there is really not much of a point in recording variables that likely have no relationship with it. Choosing the explanatory variables can also indicate further questions of interest. For instance, the researcher may want to compare the percent of “Yes” for the overall cleanliness score for vendors that mainly sell vegetables to those that mainly sell fruit leading to a comparison across groups being of interest. She may want to try to model the AMT of cantaloupe sold as a function of the cleanliness score. The average amount for the population or a subpopulation would be referred to as a parameter of interest. Formally, a parameter is a summary measure about a population. Common parameters investigated include a mean, proportion, median, or variance of different subgroups of the population. The explanatory variables she collected about the vendors included the types of crops sold, the services they provide (grow, pack, and/or ship), and whether or not they are a “Got to be NC member”. For the questionnaire, she added the additional questions below: Are there any organic or synthetic chemicals/fertilizers/pesticides/manures used on the products? Are all foods grown/processed by the vendors? What kind of soil were the products grown in? eg: organic/compost/plant material For the assessment of cleanliness, she added the following question: How many people are working? Should we talk about formalizing the other questions they want to answer here?? 2.2.4 Select Design For this study the researchers aren’t interested in doing an intervention so an observational study was being done. The major task to consider for the observational study is how to select participants from the population. The subset of the population we (attempt to) observe our data on is called the sample. The sample size is the number of measurements in the sample. Ideally, we would measure every member of our population. This is called a census. If a census can be done then the value of a population’s parameter can be found exactly by simply summarizing the population data. However, conducting a census can be extremely costly or time-intensive so most of the time a census cannot be done. This means that the information we collect would likely be different if we collected it again. Accounting for this variability is the main reason statistical analysis is needed. How the researcher selects their sample is extremely important. This method is often referred to as the sampling scheme. Using a statistically valid sampling scheme is vital to the assumptions made when doing statistical inference. A valid sampling scheme implies that every member of the population has a known and non-zero chance of inclusion in the sample. There are many good ways to select the sample and many bad ways. Need to get more info about the farmer’s market to finish this part (Talk about bad first and why bad - visuals too) Talk about good and why good - visuals too. This idea is further fleshed out at the end of the chapter. (reference/link this) Here they chose to do a stratified sample to make sure that they didn’t leave out any important subgroups. Should we talk about formalizing the other questions they want to answer here?? 2.2.5 Do Study Go and talk to chosen vendors. May have some non-response issues. Ideally a contingency for this should be developed when considering the sampling scheme. Should we talk about formalizing the other questions they want to answer here?? 2.2.6 Do Statistical Analysis Should we talk about formalizing the other questions they want to answer here?? The major goals of this study were simply to describe the vendors at the farmer’s market. In this case we can produce numerical and graphical summaries. Careful discussion of not selecting a modeling technique based on this unless it is a pilot study or an exploratory study else we have increased our nominal type I error rate… Spend a lot of time here talking about graphs of different types. Sample means, sample variances, etc. Discuss population curves vs sample histograms and the relationship. Not a formal test here but comparisons of interest etc. 2.2.7 Draw Conclusions &amp; Communicate What actionable things have we found? Likely some trends to investigate further.

The engineer responsible for the new desing needs to make sure that the packaging fits the new cookies. While the cookie manufacturing process is standardized, there’s inevitably some degree of variation in cookie size. After discussing the issue with corporate, the engineer decides that a the new cookie sleeves should be large enough to fit 95% of cookies that are baked. (The largest five percent will be marketed separately as “JUMBO” cookies.) 3.2.2 Define the object of the experiment The Engineer is tasked with determining how large the cooke sleeve needs to be. There’s no way for her to know the size of every cookie that Big Deborah’s has made (or will make going forward!), so she’ll need to collect data on existing cookies to inform her cookie sleeve size determination. 3.2.3 Select appropriate response variables If the maximum distance from any one point on the (round) cookie’s perimeter to any other point is smaller than the diameter of the cookie sleeve, then the cookie will fit. This makes “cookie diameter” a good measure for this test. It is easy to measure for each cookie and is directly relevant to the experiment’s objective. [probably have something in here about ] 3.2.4 IDentify sources of variation While the manufacturing process is standardized, there is variation in size from one cookie to the next. This is one source of variation. The engineer isn’t sure of any others. However, she knows that cookies are made in multiple factories, and that each factory has multiple ovens. Ovens and factories could also be sources of variation. 3.2.5 Choose an experimental design The Engineer knows that she needs to look at multiple cookies, since she knows that there is variation in diameter from one cookie to the next. One option would be to just use the remaining cookies in the box she has in her office (22 of the 25-count box remain). [something about convenience sample] However, she knows that cookies from the same oven are typically packaged together. If there is variation from one oven to the next, looking at the cookies she has in her office may not tell the whole story. Instead, she chooses to take every 20th cookie manufactured off the assembly line until she gets 500 cookies. [something about systematic sample] 3.2.6 Perform the test The day of the test comes, and the Engineer starts collecting cookies. However, problems arise! The plan has to shut down half-way through, so she only gets 431 cookies instead of the 500 she thought she would. However, she measures the diameters of each cookie and records the data in a spreadsheet. 3.2.7 Statistically analyze the data The initial plan had been to rank-order the 500 cookies and estimate the 95th percentile using the diamter of the 475th largets cookie. Since we didn’t get all of our data, we have to improvise. 431 doesn’t neatly yield a value such that exactly 95% are less than or equal and 5% are greater than or equal. One option is to choose the 410th largest cookie to estimate our percentile. Slightly more than 95% of cookies will have smaller diameters than this. Alternatively, we could interpolate between the 409th and 410th cookies. [reasons and logic and math for each of these] 3.2.8 Draw conclusions Based on this study, the Engineer concludes that a cookie sleeve large enough for a cookie of diameter XX will be big enough to contain 95% of Big Deborah cookies. 3.2.9 Discussion pros and cons to the approach chosen generalizing to other types of point estimates "],

["HT.html", "Chapter 5 Inference via Hypothesis Tests for One Sample 5.1 Example: Detection Probability 5.2 Hypothesis testing", " Chapter 5 Inference via Hypothesis Tests for One Sample 5.1 Example: Detection Probability An important problem for the US Army is protecting soldiers in forward positions. One of main threats to these soldiers are explosive projectiles launched from great distances. These are often refered to as “indirect fires”, since the folks launching the projectiles (“firing” the projectiles) may not have direct visibility (“line of sight”) to their target. For example, artillery like the US M777 Light Towed Howitzer can fire projectiles over 40 km, far beyond the distance a soldier operating the machine could aim it. Instead, the gun crew relies on information about where to shoot provided to them by other units on the battlefield. This allows them to effect the battle from far away and without alerting their target. To protect soldiers from similar threats, the US Army developed the Q-53 Counterfire Radar. One of this system’s primary functions is to detect incoming indirect fires and pinpoint the source of those shots. Because soliders will be relying on the Q-53 in combat, the US Government tested it extensively to better understand how it would perform in an operational setting. The testers fired shells from systems that closely resembled the artillery that might be seen on the battlefield while actual soldiers operated a Q-53. For each shell that was fired, the testers recorded whether or not the Q-53 crew was able to detect the projectile with their system. Using data from this test, evaluators were able to the likelihood that the Q-53 would detect an incoming projectile. 5.1.1 Understanding system performance Let’s take a step back and consider the data we’re getting from this test and try to understand why the testers did things the way they did. First, let’s consider the goal of this test. At the end of the day, the US Army wants to know how effective the Q-53 is at it’s job. This job is to help protect soldiers by giving them early warning if they’re under attack from indirect fires like artillery. Therefore, it’s vital that the Q-53 detect incoming projectiles with high probability. Once we understand this, the choice to measure the detection probability for incoming projectiles is completley logical. This measure ties directly to the goal of the experiment. You won’t always be able to find a response variable that ties so directly to the goal of your test, but when you do, rejoice. There are some other measures the testers could’ve used. For example, they could’ve looked at how long a projectile was detected prior to its impact on the target. Similarly, they could’ve measured the distance from the target at time of detection. Both of these measures would give more detailed information than detection alone. However, they’d be harder to measure precisely. Addiing additional instrumentation to the Q-53 and to the test projectiles being fired at the range would add elements to the experiment that would make it less realistic. Perhaps instrumenting the projectiles would make them easier to detect. Regardless, the testers deemed the detection probability adequate to make their assessment of the system. 5.1.2 Data Analysis Having identified their response variable, the testers collected data on which projectils were detected. Table 1 shows the first 20 shots collected. tb &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;datasets/Experimental/counterfire-radar/counterfire-radar.csv&quot;) %&gt;% filter(Mission %in% c(1:4)) hist(tb$Detection) It’s clear that the system detects these projectiles with a high probability, but what conclusions can we draw from these data? Does the system detect projectiles at a high enough rate to be useful to a commander in the field? Typically, you’ll want to think about these questions before designing a test or analyzing your data. In the case of this counterfire radar, the US Army has specified in requirements documents what it deems to be “good enough” in terms of detection probability. Suppose the Army requires that the system be able to detect at least 80% of incoming projectiles. Using that requirement, we can compare the probabiltiy of detection we observed in our sample and get an idea of whether or not the system is good enough: n &lt;- nrow(tb) phat &lt;- mean(tb$Detection) phat ## [1] 0.804878 Let the true probability of detection for this radar system be \\(\\pi\\), a value somewhere between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). Then our estimate for \\(\\pi\\) is denoted: \\[\\hat\\pi = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i\\] In this equation, \\(x_i\\) is 1 or a 0 depending on whether or not we detected the \\(i\\)th projectile, and \\(n\\) is the total number of observations we have. We can use this notation to state the research problem we describe above more formally: We want to determine if \\(\\pi &gt; 0.8 = 80%\\). To do this, we’re going to use our estimat, \\(\\hat \\pi\\). The simplest approach is to just say that \\(\\hat \\pi\\) is our best guess for \\(\\pi\\), so let’s just ask if \\(\\hat \\pi&gt; 0.8\\). Based on our data above, we have: $= $0.804878. This is larger than 0.8, so it looks like we’re good to go! Unforunately, \\(\\hat \\pi\\) is an estimate of \\(\\pi\\) and not the true value. It is based on a random sample, which are subject to variability. Before drawing any conclusions, it’s important to ask the question, “How sure are we that \\(\\hat\\pi\\) is close to \\(\\pi\\)?” 5.2 Hypothesis testing The framework used throughout modern science to answer these sorts of question is known as Null Hypothesis SignificanceTesting (NHST), or more concisely, hypothesis testing. The basic approach is to frame our research question as a comparison between two possible realities and then decide, based on the data, if one of those realities is sufficiently implausible to discard as an actual possibility. For our application, the two competing realities are one in which the radar’s performance meets the desired performance of the Army (that is, \\(\\pi &gt; 0.8\\)) and one where it does not (\\(\\pi \\le 0.8\\)). These possibilities are derived directly from our research question, and are typically phrased explicitly as a Null Hypothesis (denoted \\(H_0\\)) and an Alternative Hypothesis (denoted \\(H_1\\) or \\(H_a\\)). The null hypothesis is typically written in such a way that, if we can prove it is not true, we will have learned important information. For this example, if we can show that the system’s probability of detection isn’t worse than \\(0.8\\), we’ll know that it’s at least good enough to meet the desired level of performance. Therefore, we write our null and alternative thus: \\[H_0: \\pi \\le 0.8\\] \\[H_1: \\pi &gt; 0.8\\] Our goal is to determine, based on the sample we’ve collected, whether \\(H_0\\) is plausible. There are many ways that statisticians have developed over the years of determining this, but we’ll focus on one for now. The first thing to do is consider our data, which are whether or not the radar system detected each of the 41 projectiles shot during the test event. We must make some general assumptions about these data if we’re to get anyhwere. Plausible assumptions include: One shot is independent from the next The underlying probability of detection for each shot is the same If these assumptions hold, than each observation is a Bernoulli random variable with \\(P(Detect) = \\pi\\) and \\(P(NoDetect) = 1 - \\pi\\). 5.2.1 Wald tests Luckily, we have tools available to help us answer that question! Specifically, we can use the standard error, which was introduced in Chapter 4. Recall that the equation for the standard error of \\(\\hat\\pi\\) is \\[SE(\\hat\\pi) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat\\pi (1 - \\hat\\pi)}{n}}\\] For our observed data, \\(SE(\\hat\\pi) =\\) 0.06. Using these values, we can determine with greater precision whether the true performance of the radar system meets the desired level of performance. –&gt; –&gt; –&gt; "],
["CI.html", "Chapter 6 Inference via Confidence Intervals for One Sample 6.1 The normal approximation 6.2 Other types of binomial confidence intervals", " Chapter 6 Inference via Confidence Intervals for One Sample There are many ways to build confidence intervals for sample proportions. Here are a few: 6.1 The normal approximation This is the basic interval they’ve taught in introductory statistics courses since time immamorial. Or at least the past few decades, I’d have to know the history of Stats Ed to give the real timeframe. Anyway, this confidence interval uses the fact from the Central Limit Theorem, that, as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\), the sampling distribution for \\(\\hat\\pi = x/n\\) closely resembles a Normal distribution. Based on that, you get the equation: \\[\\hat\\pi \\pm z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat\\pi (1 - \\hat\\pi)}{n}}\\] 6.1.1 Analog CI We can build this CI in R pretty easily by inputting the values for the sample size, \\(n\\), and the number of “successes” or “1”s from our binary response variable. One example from class discusses a poll of 2500 people with 400 responding “Satisfactory”. For a 90% confidence interval, we have: n &lt;- 2500 x &lt;- 400 pihat &lt;- x/n alpha &lt;- 0.1 # 90% CI --&gt; alpha = 1 - .9 = 0.1 lower_bound &lt;- pihat + qnorm(alpha/2) * sqrt((pihat * (1 - pihat)/n)) upper_bound &lt;- pihat + qnorm(1 - alpha/2) * sqrt((pihat * (1 - pihat)/n)) c(lower_bound, upper_bound) ## [1] 0.1479397 0.1720603 6.1.2 Easy mode But it’s much easier to just use the binom library, which contains the function binom.confint(): # install.packages(&quot;binom&quot;) library(binom) ## Warning: package &#39;binom&#39; was built under R version 3.6.3 binom.confint(x = 400, n = 2500, conf.level = 0.9, method = &quot;asymptotic&quot;) ## method x n mean lower upper ## 1 asymptotic 400 2500 0.16 0.1479397 0.1720603 Much easier! But now that we’re using binom.confint(), we discover that we have to specify method = \"asymptotic\". But that implies that there are alternatives! And indeed, if we just remove that statement, we see that there are almost a DOZEN different methods that binom.confint() will compute for you! 6.2 Other types of binomial confidence intervals First off, most of these aren’t useful in most cases. They’re in there because (1) they’re not very hard to program, so the authors figured, “Why not?” and (2) in most cases, there is at least one circumstance where each one is the best option. (Or they’re included for historical reasons.) 6.2.1 Exact CIs, aka Clopper-Pearson For one simple example, recall the assumption that we always have to make for our Normal approximation method: \\(n * \\hat\\pi &gt; 5\\) and \\(n * (1 - \\hat\\pi) &gt; 5\\). This is required when we use the Normal approximation. It means we can’t build CIs for small-ish samples. But other methods don’t have this problem! method = \"exact\" uses what’s called the Clopper-Pearson method, which uses the Binomial distribution to calculate an “exact” confidence interval rather than rely on an approximation. While being “exact” sounds better than “approximate”, the truth of the matter is that the Clopper-Pearson interval is generally wider than it needs to be, meaning you get a less precise interval: library(dplyr) binom.confint(x = 400, n = 2500, conf.level = 0.9) %&gt;% mutate(`CI Width` = upper - lower) %&gt;% select(method, lower, upper, `CI Width`) %&gt;% arrange(`CI Width`) ## method lower upper CI Width ## 1 bayes 0.1480550 0.1721635 0.02410856 ## 2 cloglog 0.1481500 0.1722628 0.02411279 ## 3 profile 0.1481871 0.1723036 0.02411651 ## 4 wilson 0.1483082 0.1724269 0.02411870 ## 5 probit 0.1482369 0.1723573 0.02412042 ## 6 asymptotic 0.1479397 0.1720603 0.02412053 ## 7 logit 0.1483044 0.1724312 0.02412679 ## 8 agresti-coull 0.1483026 0.1724325 0.02412988 ## 9 lrt 0.1481877 0.1723265 0.02413880 ## 10 exact 0.1480388 0.1725544 0.02451559 ## 11 prop.test 0.1459601 0.1750977 0.02913765 Since we have a large sample, the differences aren’t very large, but there are times when you want every ounce of precision you can get! 6.2.2 Bayesian intervals Bayesian statistics is a school of thought that says we should try to incorporate our prior knowledge about a problem when making a decision instead of letting the data stand on its own.I don’t want to get into why some folks prefer Bayesian intervals, but if you want to, just specify method = \"bayes\" to get a Bayesian CI. 6.2.3 A good general-use CI My go-to for a simple binomial confidence interval is the Agresti-Coull method, method = \"agresti-coull\". It’s one of the weirder ones (Seriously, go look at the equation for it!), but generally performs as well or better than the competition across most scenarios. It’s more precise than method = \"exact\", doesn’t fail in small samples like method = \"asymptotic\", and doesn’t rely on a Bayesian approach. "],

["motivating-example.html", "Chapter 9 Motivating example", " Chapter 9 Motivating example The United States Air Force Academy has 24 sections of Calculus I, taught by three different types of instructors: In-uniform instructors, full-time civilian instructors, and visiting faculty. The Dean of Students wants to give students the best experience possible and make sure that all three types of instructors are doing a good job. There are plausible reasons why any one of the three could be doing well: In-uniform instructors are all members of the Air Force, and students may be extra attention in these classes because they know that these instructors rank above them in their chain of command. On the other hand, full-time instructors have been aroudn the Academy for many years and understand the Cadets and their workloads. Alternatively, visiting facutly tend to come from prestigeous institutions and may be familiar with more recently-developed pedagogical techniques. Regardless, the Dean wants to understand if there is any variation in end-of-semester grades of classes taught by these three types of instructors. At the end of the semester, she collects the average grades from each of the 24 sections. How can she go about investigating this question? Recall from Chapter 6 that we can use t-tests to compare two group means. In this case, we’d like to do a comparison across three groups, and instead of looking at a direct comparison of one group to another, what the Dean is interested in is whether there’s an overall difference across the three groups. One option might be to just do a bunch of different t-tests. We could first compare classes taught by in-uniform instructors to classes taught by full-time civilians, then compare the classes taught by the in-uniform instructors to the classes taugth by the visiting instructors, and then finally compare the classes taugth by the full-time civilains with the classes taught by the visiting facutly. We’d end up with three p-values, each addressing different questions than the one we initially set out to answer. We could do the same thing, except comparing courses taught by one type of instructor to the combined group of courses taught by the other two, and this gets a bit closer to the mark. But we’re still doing three tests that individually fail to answer the Dean’s question. What we’d like instead is a single hypothesis that we could test that direclty gets at the Dean’s concern about whether the three types of instructors were producing end-of-semester grades that were, on average, the same.

["notation.html", "Chapter 24 Appendix - Notation 24.1 Standard notation 24.2 Mixed models 24.3 Effects model representation 24.4 Estimators vs. Estimates", " Chapter 24 Appendix - Notation 24.1 Standard notation Vectors of variables are denoted with Roman letters, such as \\(x\\) and \\(Y\\). Capital letters denote random variables while lower case letters denote fixed variables. Note that these vectors may be of length 1 depending on context. Bolded values (\\(x\\)) denote matrices, and in the case of \\(Y\\), possibly single-column matrices. Unknown parameters are denoted with Greek letters, with boldface font indicating matrices. In most models, \\(Y\\) will denote the univariate response, \\(x\\) will describe a matrix of predictor variables, and \\(E\\) a vector of random errors. The Greek letter \\(\\beta\\) will be commonly used for regression parameters (either with subscripts for each values as in \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1\\) or as a vector (as in \\(X\\beta\\)). The letters \\(i, j, k,\\) and \\(l\\) will be most commonly used as subscripts or indices. \\(N\\) will typically denote a sample size (not a random vector), with subscripted versions (\\(n_i\\)) describing the number of observations in a group, and \\(p\\) describing the number of parameters in a model beyond the intercept. We may therefore describe a simple linear regresion model as: \\[Y = x\\beta + E\\] In this model, \\(Y\\) is a \\(N\\times 1\\) random vector, \\(x\\) is a \\(N\\times (p + 1)\\) matrix of fixed values, and \\(E\\) is a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector. \\(\\pi\\) is typically used to describe probability parameters, as in Bernoulli or binomial random variables. 24.2 Mixed models Still need to add something for this 24.3 Effects model representation In the effects formulation of ANOVA models, additional greek letters (\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\gamma\\), etc.) will appear as parameter effects, as will \\(\\mu\\), which will typically represent the grand mean. Group-specfic means will be denoted via subscripts: \\(\\mu_{ij}\\). When using this representation, it is convenient to describe a single observation as \\(Y_{ijk}\\), which is the \\(k\\)th observation from the group with with the \\(i\\)th level of the first factor and the \\(j\\)th level of the second factor. In the main effects version of this model, we have: \\[Y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\gamma_j + E_{ijk}\\] We can therefore estimate \\(\\mu_{ij}\\) as \\(\\hat \\mu_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k = 1}^n Y_{ijk} = \\bar{Y}_{ij\\cdot}\\). This “dot” notation can be extended to any subscript and indicates summing over the index that has been replaced by the dot. Further note that the “hat” over a paremeter value denotes the estimator for that parameter value, and the “bar” indicates an average. These features are used generally throughout this book. 24.4 Estimators vs. Estimates If we want to get pedantic, we can differentiate between estimates and estimators in our notation. Estimators are functions of random variables used to estimate parameters. Estimates are realized values of estimators. To differentiate these, we use Roman letters with hats to represent estimators (\\(\\hat B = (x&#39;x )^{-1}x&#39;Y\\)) and Greek letters with hats to represent estimates (\\(\\hat \\beta = 1.52\\)). 24.4.1 Installing R and RStudio The R software itself can be downloaded and installed by visiting the Comprehensive R Archive Network (Cran) website. Here there are links to install R for Linux, Mac, and Windows-based machines. For Windows users, follow the initial ‘Download R for Windows’ link and then click ‘install R for the first time.’ From here you should now see a Download R X.x.x for Windows link that will download a .exe file. Once downloaded run that file and follow the prompts. For Mac users, follow the initial ‘Download R for (Mac) OS X’ link and click on the link near the ‘Latest Release’ section similar to R-x.x.x.pkg. Once downloaded, you should be able to install by double clicking on the file. For Linux users, follow the initial ‘Download R for Linux’ link. Choose your OS and instructions are given on how to download R. Once you’ve installed R you’ll want to install RStudio. RStudio is a well-developed environment that makes programming in R much easier! To download head to RStudio’s download page. From here choose RStudio Desktop (Open Source License) and a page with appropriate links to install are provided. 24.4.2 Using RStudio To program in R you’ll want to open RStudio. RStudio will submit R code for you so you never actually need to open R itself. There are four main ‘areas’ of the RStudio IDE: Console (&amp; Terminal) Scripting and Viewing Window Plots/Help (&amp; Files/Packages) Environment (&amp; Connections/Git) You may wish to rearrange the panes. This can be done via the menus at the top. Choose “Tools –&gt; Global Options”. Other useful global options to change are under the appearance tab (font size, theme) and under the code tab (editing –&gt; soft-wrap, display –&gt; show whitespace). 24.4.2.1 Console To evaluate code you can type directly into the console. #simple math operations # &lt;-- is a comment - code not evaluated 3 + 7 ## [1] 10 10 * exp(3) #exp is exponential function ## [1] 200.8554 log(pi^2) #log is natural log by default ## [1] 2.28946 mean(cars$speed) ## [1] 15.4 hist(cars$speed) In the R sections of the book we spend much of our time learning the R syntax needed to create the appropriate summaries or analysis. 24.4.2.2 Scripting and Viewing Window Usually you don’t want to type code directly into the console because there isn’t an easy way to get the code for later use. Instead code is usually written in an R ‘script’ which is then saved. From an R script you can send code to console via: “Run” button (runs current line) CTRL+Enter (PC) or Command+Enter (MAC) Highlight section and do above To create a new R script you can use the menus at the top and go to File –&gt; New File –&gt; R Script. Take a moment and do this! Type the following into your script: View(cars) (note capital V) plot(cars) Submit it to the console using a button or hot key! 24.4.2.3 Plots/Help Created plots are stored in the Plots tab. This is a nice feature that allows you to cycle through past plots and easily save plots via menus. In this pane there is also a Help tab that will enable you to learn about R functions. In the console type help(hist) for instance. Information about the hist function is presented. Being able to parse these types of help files is a really useful skill! For every R function there are a few sections: Description - What the function is intended for. Usage - How to call the function, inputs required, and which inputs have default arguments. Here we see hist(x, ...). This implies there is only one required input, x, and there is no default. Below you see a more detailed call to hist that includes other inputs. Each of these inputs has an equal sign with a value after it. This is the default value for that input (since there is a default value you don’t have to specify it when you call). For instance, the breaks = \"Sturges\" input implies that the “Sturges” method is the default for determining how the bins of the histogram are created. Arguments - Describes the input requirements in more detail. Details - Information about how the function works. Values - Information about what is returned to the user. References See Also - Related functions. Examples - Highly useful section giving code you can copy and paste to see an example of how the function can be used. 24.4.2.4 Environment R stores data/info/functions/etc. in R objects. An object is a data structure having attributes and methods (more on this shortly). You can create an R object via &lt;- (recommended) or =. #save for later avg &lt;- (5 + 7 + 6) / 3 #call avg object avg ## [1] 6 #strings (text) can be saved as well words &lt;- c(&quot;Hello there!&quot;, &quot;How are you?&quot;) words ## [1] &quot;Hello there!&quot; &quot;How are you?&quot; Notice that when you send the line avg &lt;- (5+ 7 + 6) / 3 to the console (i.e. create the object avg) that nothing prints out. This is common behavior when storing the object. The output or information is saved for later use in the object. To see the output or information you then simply call the object (a default printing method is used to display it). You can look at all current objects with ls(). ls() ## [1] &quot;airquality&quot; &quot;alpha&quot; &quot;avg&quot; &quot;baseURL&quot; ## [5] &quot;Batting&quot; &quot;bodyFatData&quot; &quot;chicagoData&quot; &quot;edData&quot; ## [9] &quot;fit&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;index&quot; &quot;iris&quot; ## [13] &quot;key&quot; &quot;lower_bound&quot; &quot;mat&quot; &quot;n&quot; ## [17] &quot;neuralgiaData&quot; &quot;newTempsData&quot; &quot;phat&quot; &quot;pihat&quot; ## [21] &quot;smokeData&quot; &quot;spellData&quot; &quot;spellDataDF&quot; &quot;status&quot; ## [25] &quot;tb&quot; &quot;temp&quot; &quot;tempsData&quot; &quot;upper_bound&quot; ## [29] &quot;URL&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;value&quot; &quot;vec&quot; ## [33] &quot;words&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; Use rm() to remove an object. rm(avg) ls() ## [1] &quot;airquality&quot; &quot;alpha&quot; &quot;baseURL&quot; &quot;Batting&quot; ## [5] &quot;bodyFatData&quot; &quot;chicagoData&quot; &quot;edData&quot; &quot;fit&quot; ## [9] &quot;i&quot; &quot;index&quot; &quot;iris&quot; &quot;key&quot; ## [13] &quot;lower_bound&quot; &quot;mat&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;neuralgiaData&quot; ## [17] &quot;newTempsData&quot; &quot;phat&quot; &quot;pihat&quot; &quot;smokeData&quot; ## [21] &quot;spellData&quot; &quot;spellDataDF&quot; &quot;status&quot; &quot;tb&quot; ## [25] &quot;temp&quot; &quot;tempsData&quot; &quot;upper_bound&quot; &quot;URL&quot; ## [29] &quot;v&quot; &quot;value&quot; &quot;vec&quot; &quot;words&quot; ## [33] &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; Built-in objects exist like letters and cars. letters ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; ## [20] &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; head(cars, n = 3) ## speed dist ## 1 4 2 ## 2 4 10 ## 3 7 4 The function data() shows available built-in datasets. You should now be roughly familiar with the four main ‘areas’ of the RStudio IDE: Console (&amp; Terminal) Scripting and Viewing Window Plots/Help (&amp; Files/Packages) Environment (&amp; Connections/Git) 24.4.3 R Objects and Classes R has strong Object Oriented Programming (OOP) tools. Object: data structure with attributes (class) Method: procedures (functions) that act on object based on attributes R functions like print() or plot() act differently depending on an object’s class. class(cars) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; plot(cars) class(exp) ## [1] &quot;function&quot; plot(exp) Many R functions exist to help understand an R Object. str() (structure) str(cars) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 50 obs. of 2 variables: ## $ speed: num 4 4 7 7 8 9 10 10 10 11 ... ## $ dist : num 2 10 4 22 16 10 18 26 34 17 ... class() class(cars) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; typeof() typeof(cars) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; We’ll use these functions later to help us know how to extra information from an R object. Recall that we can create an R object via &lt;- (recommended) or =. This allocates computer memory to object. The object’s attributes depend on how you created it. vec &lt;- c(1, 4, 10) class(vec) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; fit &lt;- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) class(fit) ## [1] &quot;lm&quot; 24.4.4 Data Objects To understand how to use R for data analysis we need to understand commonly used data structures: 1. Atomic Vector (1D) 2. Matrix (2D) 3. Array (nd) (not covered) 4. Data Frame (2D) 5. List (1D) 24.4.4.1 Atomic Vector Let’s start with the most basic object and work our way up. An atomic vector is a 1D group of elements with an ordering. All of the elements must be same ‘type’. Types include numeric (integer or double), character, or logical. We create an atomic vector with the c() function (‘combine’). #vectors (1 dimensional) objects x &lt;- c(17, 22, 1, 3, -3) y &lt;- c(&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;, &quot;frog&quot;) x ## [1] 17 22 1 3 -3 y ## [1] &quot;cat&quot; &quot;dog&quot; &quot;bird&quot; &quot;frog&quot; In addition, many ‘functions’ output a numeric vector. Functions are at the heart of R so it is vital to understand them. The concept of a function is that there the function takes an input or inputs and maps those inputs to some output(s). As an example, one function that outputs a numeric vector is the seq or sequence function. To know about a function you need to know about the inputs and ouputs. For seq we have the following: + Inputs = from, to, by (among others) + Output = a sequence of numbers v &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1) v ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 str(v) ## num [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5 str tells about the object v: num says it is numeric [1:5] implies one dimensional with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 The seq function is used quite a bit. There is a shorthand way to create an integer sequence using :. 1:20 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 It is also important to know how R does math on its objects. R does elementwise addition/subtraction and multiplication/division to vectors, matrices, and data frames. (The matrix multiplicaiton operator is %*%.). 1:20/20 ## [1] 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 ## [16] 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 1:20 + 1 ## [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 As we mentioned earlier, understanding help files is really useful to being about to program in R. As functions are ubiquitous in R we often need to learn about their inputs (or arguments) and we can do so using help. To recap, our first commonly used R object for storing data is an atomic vectore. This is a 1D group of elements with an ordering where all of the elements are of the same type. Generally vectors are useful to know about but not usually useful for a storing a dataset exactly. They can often be considered as the ‘building blocks’ for other data types. 24.4.4.2 Matrix A Matrix is a 2D data structure in R whose elements are all of the same type. The first dimension refers to the rows and the second dimension refers to the columns. A 2D data object is very common. The rows often represent the observations and the columns represent the variables. Although not technically right, it is useful to think of the columns of a matrix as vectors of the same type and length. For instance, consider the three vectors created here: #populate vectors x &lt;- c(17, 3, 13, 11) y &lt;- rep(-3, times = 4) z &lt;- 1:4 These are all of the same type. This can be checked with an is. (read as ‘is dot’) function. #check &#39;type&#39; is.numeric(x) ## [1] TRUE is.numeric(y) ## [1] TRUE is.numeric(z) ## [1] TRUE Not only are these three objects the same type but they are also the same length. This can be checked using the length function. #check &#39;length&#39; length(x) ## [1] 4 length(y) ## [1] 4 length(z) ## [1] 4 Again, it is useful to visualize the columns of a potential matrix as these vectors. We can create the matrix using the matrix function. The matrix function requires us to give the data as one vector. We can combine the x, y, and z objects into one vector using the c funciton. This is the first argument to the matrix function. The only other argument required is to either specify the number of rows (nrow =) or the number of columns (ncol =) (R will attempt to figure out the one that is not given using the total length of the specified data vector). #combine in a matrix matrix(c(x, y, z), ncol = 3) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 17 -3 1 ## [2,] 3 -3 2 ## [3,] 13 -3 3 ## [4,] 11 -3 4 A matrix can also store character data as well. An example of this is given below and the number of rows is specified rather than the number of columns. Note the use of is.character from the is. family of functions. x &lt;- c(&quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;There&quot;, &quot;!&quot;) y &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) z &lt;- c(&quot;One&quot;, &quot;Two&quot;, &quot;Three&quot;) is.character(x) ## [1] TRUE matrix(c(x, y, z), nrow = 3) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] &quot;Hi&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;One&quot; ## [2,] &quot;There&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;Two&quot; ## [3,] &quot;!&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;Three&quot; To recap, a Matrix is a 2D data structure where we can think of the columns as vectors of the same type and length. These are useful for some datasets but most datasets have some numeric and some character variables. Another 2D object called a data frame is perfect for this type of data! 24.4.4.3 Data Frame A Data Frame is a 2D data structure where elements within a column must be of the same type but the columns themselves can differ in type. When thinking of a data frame, consider them as a collection (list) of vectors of the same length. A data frame can be created with the data.frame function. x &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;) y &lt;- c(1, 3, 4, -1, 5, 6) z &lt;- 10:15 data.frame(x, y, z) ## x y z ## 1 a 1 10 ## 2 b 3 11 ## 3 c 4 12 ## 4 d -1 13 ## 5 e 5 14 ## 6 f 6 15 You can also easily name the columns during creation. data.frame(char = x, data1 = y, data2 = z) ## char data1 data2 ## 1 a 1 10 ## 2 b 3 11 ## 3 c 4 12 ## 4 d -1 13 ## 5 e 5 14 ## 6 f 6 15 Notice that char, data1, and data2 become the variable names for the data frame. To recap, consider a data frame as a collection (list) of vectors of the same length. Tis type of data structure is perfect for most data sets! Most functions that read 2D data into R store it as a data frame. 24.4.4.4 List A List is a 1D group of objects with ordering. Really it is a vector that can have differing elements. Think of this in a similar way to the atomic vector previously discussed except the elements are really flexible. A list can be created with the list function. You specify the elements you want to include, separated by commas. list(1:3, rnorm(2), c(&quot;!&quot;, &quot;?&quot;)) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 0.03012394 0.08541773 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] &quot;!&quot; &quot;?&quot; Similar to a data frame, you can add names to the list elements during creation. list(seq = 1:3, normVals = rnorm(2), punctuation = c(&quot;!&quot;, &quot;?&quot;)) ## $seq ## [1] 1 2 3 ## ## $normVals ## [1] 1.116610 -1.218857 ## ## $punctuation ## [1] &quot;!&quot; &quot;?&quot; To recap, a list is a very flexible 1D object. It is really useful for more complex types of data. The table below gives a summary of the data objects we’ve covered. For most data analysis you’ll use data frames. Dimension Homogeneous Heterogeneous 1d Atomic Vector List 2d Matrix Data Frame Next we look at how to access or change parts of our these common data objects. 24.4.5 Accessing Common Data Objects When we are dealing with a data object (1D or 2D) we may want to extract a single element, certain columns, or certain rows. In this section we’ll look at how to subset or extract information from each of the common data objects covered in the previous section. 24.4.5.1 Atomic Vector (1D) For atomic vectors (and lists, see later) you can return elements using square brackets []. You may notice that when R prints a vector to the console you often see [1] next to the first element and perhaps a [#] where R has to break and move to the next line of the console. The [1] implies the element printed next is the first element of the vector (R starts its counting at 1 not 0 like some other languages). The [#] implies that the element printed to the right is the # element of the vector. This is a good reminder of how to extract values from an atomic vector. As an example, here we extract from a built-in R object called letters that is a vector of length 26 containing the letters of the alphabet. letters #built-in vector ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; ## [20] &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; letters[1] #R starts counting at 1! ## [1] &quot;a&quot; letters[26] ## [1] &quot;z&quot; To obtain more than one element you can ‘feed’ in a vector of indices to that you’d like to return. letters[1:4] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; letters[c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)] ## [1] &quot;e&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;y&quot; x &lt;- c(1, 2, 5) letters[x] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;e&quot; If you’d like to return all values except a certain subset, you can use negative indices. letters[-(1:4)] ## [1] &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; ## [20] &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; x &lt;- c(1, 2, 5) letters[-x] ## [1] &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; ## [20] &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; 24.4.5.2 Matrices (2D) For rectangular data like a matrix you can return rectangular subsets using square brackets with a comma [ , ]. Notice default row and column names when R prints a matrix! mat &lt;- matrix(c(1:4, 20:17), ncol = 2) mat ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 20 ## [2,] 2 19 ## [3,] 3 18 ## [4,] 4 17 This is a nice reminder of how to index a matrix. The value prior to the columns represents which row(s) you want to return and the value after the comma which column(s). If an index is left blank then all of that corresponding dimension (row or column) is returned. mat[c(2, 4), ] ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 2 19 ## [2,] 4 17 mat[, 1] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 mat[2, ] ## [1] 2 19 mat[2, 1] ## [1] 2 Notice that R simplifies the result where possible. That is, returns an atomic vector if you have only 1 dimension and a matrix if two. This can be changed by adding an additional argument to the [ function. mat[ , 1, drop = FALSE] ## [,1] ## [1,] 1 ## [2,] 2 ## [3,] 3 ## [4,] 4 Also, if you only give a single value in the [] then R uses the count of the value in the matrix. Counts go down columns first. mat[5] ## [1] 20 If your matrix has column names associated with it, you can also use those to return columns of interest. To add column names we can look run help(matrix) to learn how! Notice the dimnames argument. You can specify names for the rows and columns by using a list with two vectors. The first vector indicating row names and the second column names. If we don’t want to give rownames we can give a NULL (a special value in R that is used for undefined values - here giving no specification of row names). We can do this and give a character vector for the column names. mat&lt;-matrix(c(1:4, 20:17), ncol = 2, dimnames = list(NULL, c(&quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;)) ) mat ## First Second ## [1,] 1 20 ## [2,] 2 19 ## [3,] 3 18 ## [4,] 4 17 Now we can request columns be using a single name or a character vector of names. mat[, &quot;First&quot;] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 To return all but certain parts of a matrix you can still use negative indices but note that this won’t work with column names. mat[-c(1,3), -&quot;First&quot;] ## Error in -&quot;First&quot;: invalid argument to unary operator mat[-c(1,3), &quot;First&quot;] ## [1] 2 4 24.4.5.3 Data Frames (2D) Since a data frame is also a rectangular data object you can return rectangular subsets using square brackets with a comma [ , ]! As an example, we’ll subset the built-in iris data frame. To get an idea about this object we can run str(iris). str(iris) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 150 obs. of 6 variables: ## $ Sepal.Length: num 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ... ## $ Sepal.Width : num 3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ... ## $ Petal.Length: num 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ... ## $ Petal.Width : num 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ... ## $ Species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ extra : chr &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; ... We can see this is a data frame with a few columns, four are numeric and one is a factor (a special type of character vector essentially - these will be covered when we discuss plotting). iris[1:4, 2:4] ## Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## 1 3.5 1.4 0.2 ## 2 3.0 1.4 0.2 ## 3 3.2 1.3 0.2 ## 4 3.1 1.5 0.2 iris[1, ] ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species extra ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa a iris[, 1] ## [1] 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 5.4 4.6 5.0 4.4 4.9 5.4 4.8 4.8 4.3 5.8 5.7 5.4 5.1 ## [19] 5.7 5.1 5.4 5.1 4.6 5.1 4.8 5.0 5.0 5.2 5.2 4.7 4.8 5.4 5.2 5.5 4.9 5.0 ## [37] 5.5 4.9 4.4 5.1 5.0 4.5 4.4 5.0 5.1 4.8 5.1 4.6 5.3 5.0 7.0 6.4 6.9 5.5 ## [55] 6.5 5.7 6.3 4.9 6.6 5.2 5.0 5.9 6.0 6.1 5.6 6.7 5.6 5.8 6.2 5.6 5.9 6.1 ## [73] 6.3 6.1 6.4 6.6 6.8 6.7 6.0 5.7 5.5 5.5 5.8 6.0 5.4 6.0 6.7 6.3 5.6 5.5 ## [91] 5.5 6.1 5.8 5.0 5.6 5.7 5.7 6.2 5.1 5.7 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 50 entries ] Notice the simplification done when a single column is selected. R will simplify to a vector unless drop = FALSE is included as done in the matrix section. (The simplification doesn’t occur when a single row is selected because data frames are actually lists - we’ll discuss this more in the list section!) You can use columns names to subset as well. iris[1:10 , c(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;)] ## Sepal.Length Species ## 1 5.1 setosa ## 2 4.9 setosa ## 3 4.7 setosa ## 4 4.6 setosa ## 5 5.0 setosa ## 6 5.4 setosa ## 7 4.6 setosa ## 8 5.0 setosa ## 9 4.4 setosa ## 10 4.9 setosa The most common way to access a single columns is to use the dollar sign operator. iris$Sepal.Length ## [1] 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 5.4 4.6 5.0 4.4 4.9 5.4 4.8 4.8 4.3 5.8 5.7 5.4 5.1 ## [19] 5.7 5.1 5.4 5.1 4.6 5.1 4.8 5.0 5.0 5.2 5.2 4.7 4.8 5.4 5.2 5.5 4.9 5.0 ## [37] 5.5 4.9 4.4 5.1 5.0 4.5 4.4 5.0 5.1 4.8 5.1 4.6 5.3 5.0 7.0 6.4 6.9 5.5 ## [55] 6.5 5.7 6.3 4.9 6.6 5.2 5.0 5.9 6.0 6.1 5.6 6.7 5.6 5.8 6.2 5.6 5.9 6.1 ## [73] 6.3 6.1 6.4 6.6 6.8 6.7 6.0 5.7 5.5 5.5 5.8 6.0 5.4 6.0 6.7 6.3 5.6 5.5 ## [91] 5.5 6.1 5.8 5.0 5.6 5.7 5.7 6.2 5.1 5.7 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 50 entries ] A nice benefit of using RStudio is that column names will be filled in automatically as you type. In your console do the following: Type iris$ If no choices - hit tab Scroll up and down or continue typing to highlight the column of interest Hit tab again to choose 24.4.5.4 Lists (1D) As a list is a 1D data object we can use single square brackets [ ] for multiple list elements. x &lt;- list(&quot;HI&quot;, c(10:20), 1) x ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;HI&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 1 x[2:3] ## [[1]] ## [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 1 We can use double square brackets [[ ]] (or [ ]) to return a single list element. The major difference is in whether or not a list with the element chosen is returned or just the element itself. [[ will return just the element requested. x &lt;- list(&quot;HI&quot;, c(10:20), 1) x[1] ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;HI&quot; x[[1]] ## [1] &quot;HI&quot; x[[2]] ## [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 x[[2]][4:5] ## [1] 13 14 Recall we could name our list elements. If they are named we can use the $ similar to a data frame. x &lt;- list(&quot;HI&quot;, c(10:20), 1) str(x) ## List of 3 ## $ : chr &quot;HI&quot; ## $ : int [1:11] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ... ## $ : num 1 x &lt;- list(First = &quot;Hi&quot;, Second = c(10:20), Third = 1) x$Second ## [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Under the hood a data frame is just a list of equal length vectors! str(x) ## List of 3 ## $ First : chr &quot;Hi&quot; ## $ Second: int [1:11] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ... ## $ Third : num 1 str(iris) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 150 obs. of 6 variables: ## $ Sepal.Length: num 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ... ## $ Sepal.Width : num 3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ... ## $ Petal.Length: num 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ... ## $ Petal.Width : num 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ... ## $ Species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ extra : chr &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; ... typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; typeof(iris) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; This means we can index a data frame in a similar way to how we index a list if we want. iris[[2]] ## [1] 3.5 3.0 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 3.7 3.4 3.0 3.0 4.0 4.4 3.9 3.5 ## [19] 3.8 3.8 3.4 3.7 3.6 3.3 3.4 3.0 3.4 3.5 3.4 3.2 3.1 3.4 4.1 4.2 3.1 3.2 ## [37] 3.5 3.6 3.0 3.4 3.5 2.3 3.2 3.5 3.8 3.0 3.8 3.2 3.7 3.3 3.2 3.2 3.1 2.3 ## [55] 2.8 2.8 3.3 2.4 2.9 2.7 2.0 3.0 2.2 2.9 2.9 3.1 3.0 2.7 2.2 2.5 3.2 2.8 ## [73] 2.5 2.8 2.9 3.0 2.8 3.0 2.9 2.6 2.4 2.4 2.7 2.7 3.0 3.4 3.1 2.3 3.0 2.5 ## [91] 2.6 3.0 2.6 2.3 2.7 3.0 2.9 2.9 2.5 2.8 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 50 entries ] Lastly, one nice thing about lists (and data frames) is that you can use partial matching with [[ and $. iris$Sp[1:10] ## [1] setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa ## Levels: setosa versicolor virginica iris[[&quot;Petal.Len&quot;, exact = FALSE]] ## [1] 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.6 1.4 1.1 1.2 1.5 1.3 1.4 ## [19] 1.7 1.5 1.7 1.5 1.0 1.7 1.9 1.6 1.6 1.5 1.4 1.6 1.6 1.5 1.5 1.4 1.5 1.2 ## [37] 1.3 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.6 1.9 1.4 1.6 1.4 1.5 1.4 4.7 4.5 4.9 4.0 ## [55] 4.6 4.5 4.7 3.3 4.6 3.9 3.5 4.2 4.0 4.7 3.6 4.4 4.5 4.1 4.5 3.9 4.8 4.0 ## [73] 4.9 4.7 4.3 4.4 4.8 5.0 4.5 3.5 3.8 3.7 3.9 5.1 4.5 4.5 4.7 4.4 4.1 4.0 ## [91] 4.4 4.6 4.0 3.3 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.3 3.0 4.1 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 50 entries ] This is less important now that RStudio can auto-complete long column names. 24.4.6 Basics of R Recap RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment) R Objects and Classes Data Objects &amp; Basic Manipulation Dimension Homogeneous Heterogeneous 1d Atomic Vector List 2d Matrix Data Frame Basic access via Atomic vectors - x[ ] Matrices - x[ , ] Data Frames - x[ , ] or x$name Lists - x[ ], x[[ ]], or x$name 24.4.7 Data Manipulation Ideas As you can see it isn’t too difficult to bring well structured raw data into R. You should now have the basics of reading in delimited, Excel, SAS, SPSS, JSON, and XML data as well as how to connect to a database and contact an API. Once you have your data you may want to manipulate it in some way. Often we want to grab only certain types of observations (filter rows). We also want to only look at only certain variables (select columns). Other times we want to create new variables that may be functions of the data in the data set. When doing data manipulation it is vital to make your work reproducible! Traditionally documentation has been done through comments (# in R) in your R script. This is being replaced by using a ‘Notebook’ environment like R Markdown. 24.4.8 Documenting with Markdown You may have heard of JUPYTER notebooks. This is a program that allows you to weave plain text with formatting characters along side code. JUPYTER allows you to call Julia, Python, R, or SAS code (among others). R Markdown is a built in notebook for R studio! A nice intro video is available here. R Markdown is designed to be used in three ways (R for Data Science): Communicating to decision makers (focus on conclusions not code) Collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!) As environment to do data science (documents what you did and what you were thinking) Most have heard of HTML or HyperText Mark-up Language. This is really just plain text that a web browser like firefox interprets and renders. Markdown is a specific markup language that has easier syntax but is not as powerful. Any plain text file can be used although the .Rmd extension associates the file with R Studio. RStudio makes it easy to create a Markdown document. You can create many commonly used types of output including HTML, PDF, Word, and HTML slides. An R Markdown file contains three important types of content: (Optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s Chunks of R code Text mixed with simple text formatting instructions The YAML header defines settings for document: --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; author: &quot;First Last&quot; date: &quot;xxxx&quot; output: html_document --- The hot key combination of CTRL/CMD + Shift + k ‘knits’ (or creates the output type) via this information. Code Chunks can contain any R code. These can be started by typing ```{r} out or with CTRL/CMD + Alt + I. This code will be executed when document is created and the chunks will be evaulated sequentially. Options can be specified on individual code chunks to hide their code or output (among other things). Below you’ll see plain text with markdown sytnax included: ##R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see &lt;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&gt;. When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. When the file is created ## becomes a header, “&lt;…&gt;” a link, and **Knit** bold font. You can learn much more about how to use R Markdown with this handy cheat sheet. The key idea here is that you can easily write down your thought process and document all of the changes you make to your data. This creates a reproducible final product! 24.4.9 Logical Statements Our current goal is to subset rows or columns of a dataset. To do this efficiently we need to learn about logical statements. A logical statement is a comparison that resolves as TRUE or FALSE. R has all of the standard comparison operators: == equal to != not equal to &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;= less than (or equal) and greater than (or equal) &quot;hi&quot; == &quot; hi&quot; #== is comparison ## [1] FALSE &quot;hi&quot; == &quot;hi&quot; ## [1] TRUE 4 &gt;= 1 ## [1] TRUE 4 != 1 ## [1] TRUE Sometimes we see issues due to a loss of precision when doing mathematical operations. sqrt(3)^2 == 3 ## [1] FALSE The near function from the dplyr package can help with this type of situation. dplyr::near(sqrt(3)^2, 3) ## [1] TRUE Another common way to do a logical statement in R is to use an is. family function. is.numeric(&quot;Word&quot;) ## [1] FALSE is.numeric(10) ## [1] TRUE is.character(&quot;10&quot;) ## [1] TRUE is.na(c(1:2, NA, 3)) ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE is.matrix(c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;)) ## [1] FALSE How do we use logical statements to subset our data? Logical vectors can be used for indexing an R object. The concept is: Feed index a vector of TRUE/FALSE or 0/1 values R will return elements where TRUE or 1 occurred Let’s subset the built-in iris data set. First we’ll convert it to a tibble so it prints nicely. iris &lt;- tbl_df(iris) iris Now, we can create an indexing vector corresponding to some condition of interest. For instance, we may want to only look at the Species ‘setosa’ flowers. iris$Species == &quot;setosa&quot; #vector indicating setosa values ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [13] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [25] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [37] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [49] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [61] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [73] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [85] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [97] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 50 entries ] Now we can feed this in as our row index to the [ function. Remember for rectangular data the first index you give refers to the rows and the second to columns. iris[iris$Species == &quot;setosa&quot;, ] ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species extra ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa a ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa a ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa a ## 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa a ## 8 5.0 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa a ## 9 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 10 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa a ## 11 5.4 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa a ## 12 4.8 3.4 1.6 0.2 setosa a ## 13 4.8 3.0 1.4 0.1 setosa a ## 14 4.3 3.0 1.1 0.1 setosa a ## 15 5.8 4.0 1.2 0.2 setosa a ## 16 5.7 4.4 1.5 0.4 setosa a ## [ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 34 rows ] Rather than use [, a base R function called subset can be used. subset(iris, Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species extra ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa a ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa a ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa a ## 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa a ## 8 5.0 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa a ## 9 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 10 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa a ## 11 5.4 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa a ## 12 4.8 3.4 1.6 0.2 setosa a ## 13 4.8 3.0 1.4 0.1 setosa a ## 14 4.3 3.0 1.1 0.1 setosa a ## 15 5.8 4.0 1.2 0.2 setosa a ## 16 5.7 4.4 1.5 0.4 setosa a ## [ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 34 rows ] This function works quite well but we want to work in the tidyverse. The filter function from the dplyr package (installed with tidyverse) will be our function of choice. For filter the first argument is the data frame (or tibble) and the second is the logical statement used for indexing the rows. filter(iris, Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species extra ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa a ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa a ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa a ## 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa a ## 8 5.0 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa a ## 9 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa a ## 10 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa a ## 11 5.4 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa a ## 12 4.8 3.4 1.6 0.2 setosa a ## 13 4.8 3.0 1.4 0.1 setosa a ## 14 4.3 3.0 1.1 0.1 setosa a ## 15 5.8 4.0 1.2 0.2 setosa a ## 16 5.7 4.4 1.5 0.4 setosa a ## [ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 34 rows ] Often we’ll want to subset based on more than one condition. These can be created using standard logical operators. In R these are: &amp; ‘and’ | ‘or’ Operator A,B true A true, B false A,B false &amp; A &amp; B = TRUE A &amp; B = FALSE A &amp; B = FALSE | A | B = TRUE A | B = TRUE A | B = FALSE For the most part we’ll want to use the single &amp; or |. &amp;&amp; and || are alternatives that only look at only first comparison done (if given a vector of comparisons). A quick example of the compound logical syntax is given below. Parenthesis are not necessary but are quite useful to keep things straight! Here we generate 10 random values between 0 and 1 (set.seed just starts the random number generator at a specific spot so we can get the same 10 values each time we create this document!). We use | to return TRUE if the randomly generated value is either below 0.25 or above 0.75. set.seed(3) x &lt;- runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 1) x ## [1] 0.1680415 0.8075164 0.3849424 0.3277343 0.6021007 0.6043941 0.1246334 ## [8] 0.2946009 0.5776099 0.6309793 (x &lt; 0.25) | (x &gt; 0.75) ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE With this kind of syntax we can now create an indexing vector to only pull out large petal setosa flowers: (iris$Petal.Length &gt; 1.5) &amp; (iris$Petal.Width &gt; 0.3) &amp; (iris$Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [25] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [37] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [49] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [61] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [73] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [85] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [97] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 50 entries ] Using this in the filter function we return only a few observations corresponding to our condition. filter(iris, (Petal.Length &gt; 1.5) &amp; (Petal.Width &gt; 0.3) &amp; (Species == &quot;setosa&quot;)) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species extra ## 1 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa a ## 2 5.1 3.3 1.7 0.5 setosa a ## 3 5.0 3.4 1.6 0.4 setosa a ## 4 5.0 3.5 1.6 0.6 setosa a ## 5 5.1 3.8 1.9 0.4 setosa a 24.4.10 dplyr The tidyverse has many useful packages for common data manipulation tasks. Make sure library(tidyverse) has been run when working through this section! Two major packages for data manipulation are: -dplry package made for most standard data manipulation tasks tidyr package reshapes data (wide and long format, split columns, etc) This section focuses on the most useful functions from the dplyr package: tbl_df() - convert data frame to one with better printing filter() - subset rows arrange() - reorder rows select() - subset columns rename() - rename columns Later we’ll look at mutate() - add newly created column transmute() - create new variable group_by() - group rows by a variable summarise() - apply basic function to data One really nice thing about the functions in the tidyverse is that the syntax is mostly consistent (save ggplot2). The basic syntax is function(tibble, actions, ...) Let’s get started! We’ve seen tbl_df a few times. This function converts a data frame to one with better printing and no simplification. To use it we can simply ‘wrap’ data frame with it. In this section we’ll do examples on datasets from the Lahman pacakge. This package has data about baseball players dating back from the start of professional baseball. #install.packages(&quot;Lahman&quot;) library(Lahman) #old method for previewing a dataset head(Batting, n = 4) #look at just first 4 observations ## # A tibble: 4 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 abercda~ 1871 1 TRO NA 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 addybo01 1871 1 RC1 NA 25 118 30 32 6 0 0 ## 3 allisar~ 1871 1 CL1 NA 29 137 28 40 4 5 0 ## 4 allisdo~ 1871 1 WS3 NA 27 133 28 44 10 2 2 ## # ... with 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, ## # SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, GIDP &lt;int&gt; Batting &lt;- tbl_df(Batting) Batting ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 abercda~ 1871 1 TRO NA 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 addybo01 1871 1 RC1 NA 25 118 30 32 6 0 0 ## 3 allisar~ 1871 1 CL1 NA 29 137 28 40 4 5 0 ## 4 allisdo~ 1871 1 WS3 NA 27 133 28 44 10 2 2 ## 5 ansonca~ 1871 1 RC1 NA 25 120 29 39 11 3 0 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; If the data has been read in with haven, readxl, or readr, it is probably in this format already! 24.4.10.1 Row Manipulations Again, we may to do a subset based on the rows of our dataset. We just looked at using the filter function to subset rows or observations of a dataset. Let’s look at a few more examples. We may only want to return observations from the Batting dataset corresponding to the Pittsburgh Pirates (PIT). filter(Batting, teamID == &quot;PIT&quot;) ## # A tibble: 4,817 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 barklsa~ 1887 1 PIT NL 89 340 44 76 10 4 1 ## 2 beeched~ 1887 1 PIT NL 41 169 15 41 8 0 2 ## 3 bishobi~ 1887 1 PIT NL 3 9 0 0 0 0 0 ## 4 brownto~ 1887 1 PIT NL 47 192 30 47 3 4 0 ## 5 carrofr~ 1887 1 PIT NL 102 421 71 138 24 15 6 ## # ... with 4,812 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; We could use a compound logical to only return Pirate data from the year 2000. filter(Batting, teamID == &quot;PIT&quot; &amp; yearID == 2000) ## # A tibble: 46 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 anderji~ 2000 1 PIT NL 27 50 5 7 1 0 0 ## 2 arroybr~ 2000 1 PIT NL 21 21 2 3 2 0 0 ## 3 avenbr01 2000 1 PIT NL 72 148 18 37 11 0 5 ## 4 benjami~ 2000 1 PIT NL 93 233 28 63 18 2 2 ## 5 bensokr~ 2000 1 PIT NL 32 65 3 6 2 0 0 ## # ... with 41 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, CS &lt;int&gt;, ## # BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, GIDP &lt;int&gt; Another useful row operation is to rearrange the data based on some criteria. The arrange function allows us to sort a data set by numeric or character variables. For instance we could reorder alphabetically by the teamID variable. arrange(Batting, teamID) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 berrych~ 1884 1 ALT UA 7 25 2 6 0 0 0 ## 2 brownji~ 1884 1 ALT UA 21 88 12 22 2 2 1 ## 3 carropa~ 1884 1 ALT UA 11 49 4 13 1 0 0 ## 4 connojo~ 1884 1 ALT UA 3 11 0 1 0 0 0 ## 5 crosscl~ 1884 1 ALT UA 2 7 1 4 1 0 0 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; A secondary arrangement can be done as well (and third, etc.) arrange(Batting, teamID, G) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 daisege~ 1884 1 ALT UA 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 crosscl~ 1884 1 ALT UA 2 7 1 4 1 0 0 ## 3 manloch~ 1884 1 ALT UA 2 7 1 3 0 0 0 ## 4 connojo~ 1884 1 ALT UA 3 11 0 1 0 0 0 ## 5 shafff01 1884 1 ALT UA 6 19 1 3 0 0 0 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; The arrangement can be done descending as well by giving the column (variable) with desc. arrange(Batting, teamID, desc(G)) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 22 ## playerID yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B HR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 smithge~ 1884 1 ALT UA 25 108 9 34 8 1 0 ## 2 harrifr~ 1884 1 ALT UA 24 95 10 25 2 1 0 ## 3 doughch~ 1884 1 ALT UA 23 85 6 22 5 0 0 ## 4 murphjo~ 1884 1 ALT UA 23 94 10 14 1 0 0 ## 5 brownji~ 1884 1 ALT UA 21 88 12 22 2 2 1 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; 24.4.10.2 Column Manipulations We may want to look at only certain variables (select columns). The select function from the dplyr package allows us to choose columns of interest. We’ve seen the use of $ and [ , ] to do this already but select offers many advantages. Same syntax as tidyverse functions Useful ways to use character matching to select columns Let’s see it in action! To choose a single column of interest just supply the column name (or position) after the tibble. select(Batting, X2B) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 1 ## X2B ## &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 ## 2 6 ## 3 4 ## 4 10 ## 5 11 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows Multiple columns can be selected by giving multiple column names. select(Batting, playerID, X2B) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 2 ## playerID X2B ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 abercda01 0 ## 2 addybo01 6 ## 3 allisar01 4 ## 4 allisdo01 10 ## 5 ansonca01 11 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows There are many ways to select multiple columsn (variables). For instance, contiguous columns can be selected using the :. #all columns between select(Batting, X2B:HR) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 3 ## X2B X3B HR ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 0 ## 2 6 0 0 ## 3 4 5 0 ## 4 10 2 2 ## 5 11 3 0 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows Character matching can be done to select all columns that contain a certain character. #all columns containing select(Batting, contains(&quot;X&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 2 ## X2B X3B ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 ## 2 6 0 ## 3 4 5 ## 4 10 2 ## 5 11 3 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows Similary, there is a starts_with and ends_with function. #all columns starting with select(Batting, starts_with(&quot;X&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 2 ## X2B X3B ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 ## 2 6 0 ## 3 4 5 ## 4 10 2 ## 5 11 3 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows #multiple selections select(Batting, starts_with(&quot;X&quot;), ends_with(&quot;ID&quot;), G) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 7 ## X2B X3B playerID yearID teamID lgID G ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 abercda01 1871 TRO NA 1 ## 2 6 0 addybo01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## 3 4 5 allisar01 1871 CL1 NA 29 ## 4 10 2 allisdo01 1871 WS3 NA 27 ## 5 11 3 ansonca01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows Sometimes we want to rename variables. This can be done with the rename function. #rename our previous selection rename(select(Batting, starts_with(&quot;X&quot;), ends_with(&quot;ID&quot;), G), &quot;Doubles&quot; = X2B, &quot;Triples&quot; = X3B) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 7 ## Doubles Triples playerID yearID teamID lgID G ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 abercda01 1871 TRO NA 1 ## 2 6 0 addybo01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## 3 4 5 allisar01 1871 CL1 NA 29 ## 4 10 2 allisdo01 1871 WS3 NA 27 ## 5 11 3 ansonca01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows You may notice this is kind function nesting makes this code difficult for humans to parse. Piping or Chaining can be used to make the use of multiple functions easier! %&gt;% is the piping operator. Generically, piping does the following x %&gt;% f(y) turns into f(x,y) x %&gt;% f(y) %&gt;% g(z) turns into g(f(x, y), z) Since the tidyverse functions all have the same syntax, piping works wonders for readability! Piping can be used with functions outside the tidyverse if this structure works. Let’s rewrite our previous nested function with piping. When reading code with piping, read %&gt;% as the word ‘then.’ Batting data set (then) select these columns (then) rename the variables. Batting %&gt;% select(starts_with(&quot;X&quot;), ends_with(&quot;ID&quot;), G) %&gt;% rename(&quot;Doubles&quot; = X2B, &quot;Triples&quot; = X3B) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 7 ## Doubles Triples playerID yearID teamID lgID G ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 0 abercda01 1871 TRO NA 1 ## 2 6 0 addybo01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## 3 4 5 allisar01 1871 CL1 NA 29 ## 4 10 2 allisdo01 1871 WS3 NA 27 ## 5 11 3 ansonca01 1871 RC1 NA 25 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows We may also wish to reorder our columns (variables). This can be done using select. The everything function is handy so you don’t have to list all the variables out if you only want to reorder a few. Batting %&gt;% select(playerID, HR, everything()) ## # A tibble: 105,861 x 22 ## playerID HR yearID stint teamID lgID G AB R H X2B X3B ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 abercda~ 0 1871 1 TRO NA 1 4 0 0 0 0 ## 2 addybo01 0 1871 1 RC1 NA 25 118 30 32 6 0 ## 3 allisar~ 0 1871 1 CL1 NA 29 137 28 40 4 5 ## 4 allisdo~ 2 1871 1 WS3 NA 27 133 28 44 10 2 ## 5 ansonca~ 0 1871 1 RC1 NA 25 120 29 39 11 3 ## # ... with 1.059e+05 more rows, and 10 more variables: RBI &lt;int&gt;, SB &lt;int&gt;, ## # CS &lt;int&gt;, BB &lt;int&gt;, SO &lt;int&gt;, IBB &lt;int&gt;, HBP &lt;int&gt;, SH &lt;int&gt;, SF &lt;int&gt;, ## # GIDP &lt;int&gt; Another commonly done column manipulation is the creating of new variables. Given a data frame and an appropriate length vector (new variable) we can use cbind (column bind) to add the variable to the data frame. temp &lt;- cbind(iris, extra = rep(&quot;a&quot;, 150)) str(temp) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 150 obs. of 7 variables: ## $ Sepal.Length: num 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ... ## $ Sepal.Width : num 3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ... ## $ Petal.Length: num 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ... ## $ Petal.Width : num 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ... ## $ Species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ extra : chr &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; ... ## $ extra : Factor w/ 1 level &quot;a&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... More simply we can just add the new variable as a named (list) element! iris$extra &lt;- rep(&quot;a&quot;, 150) str(iris) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 150 obs. of 6 variables: ## $ Sepal.Length: num 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ... ## $ Sepal.Width : num 3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ... ## $ Petal.Length: num 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ... ## $ Petal.Width : num 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ... ## $ Species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ extra : chr &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; ... To stay in the tidyverse and add more functionality we can use two functions from dplyr: mutate() - add newly created column(s) to current data frame transmute() - create new data frame with created variable(s) The syntax for these functions is similar to previous. We simply name the new variables after specifying our data set. mutate(data, newVarName = functionOfData, newVarName2 = functionOfData, ...)

This allows code to be executed only under certain conditions. The main way this is done is through if then else syntax. if (condition) { then execute code } #if then else if (condition) { execute this code } else { execute this code } #Or more if statements if (condition) { execute this code } else if (condition2) { execute this code } else if (condition3) { execute this code } else { #if no conditions met execute this code } Consider the built-in data set airquality. This hasdaily air quality measurements in New York from May (Day 1) to September (Day 153) in 1973. airquality &lt;- tbl_df(airquality) airquality ## # A tibble: 153 x 7 ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day status ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 LightWind ## 2 36 118 8 72 5 2 LightWind ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 Windy ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 Windy ## 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 Windy ## # ... with 148 more rows We may want to code a wind category variable: high wind days (15mph \\(\\leq\\) wind) windy days (10mph \\(\\leq\\) wind &lt; 15mph) lightwind days (6mph \\(\\leq\\) wind &lt; 10mph) calm days (wind \\(\\leq\\) 6mph) We may think using of using the standard if statements above. The issue is that if(condition) can only take in a single comparison. if(airquality$Wind &gt;= 15) { &quot;High Wind&quot; } ## Warning in if (airquality$Wind &gt;= 15) {: the condition has length &gt; 1 and only ## the first element will be used If you’ve programmed before you may think about this as an initial plan: loop through each observation use if then else to determine wind status There are a number of ways to do looping in R for while repeat The idea of a loop is to run code repeatedly changing something each time. The syntax for the for loop is for(index in values){ code to be run } The index defines the ‘counter’ or variable that varies as the loop iterates and ‘values’ define which values the index takes on. for (i in 1:10){ print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 ## [1] 6 ## [1] 7 ## [1] 8 ## [1] 9 ## [1] 10 for (index in c(&quot;cat&quot;,&quot;hat&quot;,&quot;worm&quot;)){ print(index) } ## [1] &quot;cat&quot; ## [1] &quot;hat&quot; ## [1] &quot;worm&quot; If we want to code our wind variable we could run a for loop with if logic inside: status&lt;-vector() #initialize vector to save results for (i in 1:nrow(airquality)){ if(airquality$Wind[i] &gt;= 15){ status[i] &lt;- &quot;HighWind&quot; } else if (airquality$Wind[i] &gt;= 10){ status[i] &lt;- &quot;Windy&quot; } else if (airquality$Wind[i] &gt;= 6){ status[i] &lt;- &quot;LightWind&quot; } else if (airquality$Wind[i] &gt;= 0){ status[i] &lt;- &quot;Calm&quot; } else { status[i] &lt;- &quot;Error&quot; } } Then we can append the new variable to our dataset. airquality$status &lt;- status airquality$status ## [1] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [7] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [13] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; ## [19] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [25] &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [31] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [37] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [43] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; ## [49] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [55] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [61] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [67] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [73] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [79] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [85] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [91] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [97] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 53 entries ] This works just fine! Some other things to be aware of with loops: break kicks you out of the loop for (i in 1:5){ if (i == 3){ break } print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 next jumps to the next iteration of the loop for (i in 1:5){ if (i == 3){ next } print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 while loop are similar while(condition) { expression to evaluate modify condition? } The main issue with loops in R is that they are inefficient. R is an interpreted language so it must figure out how to evaluate code at each iteration of loop, slowing it down. Vectorized functions are much faster! These functions work on an entire vector at once so R doesn’t have to figure things out as often. ifelse() is a vectorized version of if then else. The syntax is: ifelse(vector_condition, if_true_do_this, if_false_do_this) Now to create our Wind status variable we can nest ifelse statements. ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 15, &quot;HighWind&quot;, ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 10, &quot;Windy&quot;, ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 6, &quot;LightWind&quot;, &quot;Calm&quot;))) ## [1] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [7] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [13] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; ## [19] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [25] &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [31] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [37] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [43] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;HighWind&quot; ## [49] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [55] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [61] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; ## [67] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [73] &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [79] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [85] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [91] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;LightWind&quot; ## [97] &quot;LightWind&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Calm&quot; &quot;Windy&quot; ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 53 entries ] ifelse can also easily be used with transmute() or mutate()! mutate(airquality, status = ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 15, &quot;HighWind&quot;, ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 10, &quot;Windy&quot;, ifelse(airquality$Wind &gt;= 6, &quot;LightWind&quot;, &quot;Calm&quot;))) ) ## # A tibble: 153 x 7 ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day status ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 LightWind ## 2 36 118 8 72 5 2 LightWind ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 Windy ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 Windy ## 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 Windy ## # ... with 148 more rows Note: the cut function can also be used to categorize a numeric variable pretty easily. This covers the major uses of dplyr for manipulating rows and columns. dplyr also has great functionality for doing joins similar to SQL. We’ll also see how it can be used to create basic numeric summaries using group_by and summarize. The cheat sheet is a great reference! Recap of basic commands: tbl_df - convert data frame to one with better printing filter - subset rows arrange - reorder rows select - subset columns rename - reorder columns mutate/transmute - create new variable 24.4.11 Reshaping Data We’ve talked about rows being observations and columns being variables. This is generally how most statistical analysis software likes their data to be formatted. This is called ‘long’ format data - each row is an observation. Sometimes data doesn’t come that way! Data may have observations across some columns since viewing data is often more natural that way. For example, consider the weather data set below. tempsData &lt;- read_table2(file = &quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/cityTemps.txt&quot;) tempsData ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## city = col_character(), ## sun = col_double(), ## mon = col_double(), ## tue = col_double(), ## wed = col_double(), ## thr = col_double(), ## fri = col_double(), ## sat = col_double() ## ) ## # A tibble: 6 x 8 ## city sun mon tue wed thr fri sat ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 atlanta 81 87 83 79 88 91 94 ## 2 baltimore 73 75 70 78 73 75 79 ## 3 charlotte 82 80 75 82 83 88 93 ## 4 denver 72 71 67 68 72 71 58 ## 5 ellington 51 42 47 52 55 56 59 ## 6 frankfort 70 70 72 70 74 74 79 This data set is said to be in ‘wide’ format because columns represent observations. For most analyses this type of data will need to be reshaped into long format. The tidyr package can be used for this purpose! The gather function takes multiple columns and gathers them into key-value pairs. This tkes wide data and makes it long. Similarly there is a spread function takes two columns (key &amp; value) and spreads in to multiple columns. This takes long data and makes it wide. Let’s switch the tempsData dataset to ‘long’ form with gather().

We can split the date variable by the / that separates the day, month, and year to create three new columns. Using remove = FALSE keeps the original variable (date) and convert = TRUE attempts to convert the newly created variables to numeric if possible. chicagoData %&gt;% separate(date, c(&quot;Day&quot;, &quot;Month&quot;, &quot;Year&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;, convert = TRUE, remove = FALSE) ## # A tibble: 1,461 x 14 ## X city date Day Month Year death temp dewpoint pm10 o3 time ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3654 chic 1/1/~ 1 1 1997 137 36 37.5 13.1 5.66 3654 ## 2 3655 chic 1/2/~ 1 2 1997 123 45 47.2 41.9 5.53 3655 ## 3 3656 chic 1/3/~ 1 3 1997 127 40 38 27.0 6.29 3656 ## 4 3657 chic 1/4/~ 1 4 1997 146 51.5 45.5 25.1 7.54 3657 ## 5 3658 chic 1/5/~ 1 5 1997 102 27 11.2 15.3 20.8 3658 ## # ... with 1,456 more rows, and 2 more variables: season &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt; Similarly we can combine columns with unite.

Our plan for this section is as follows: Look at common raw data formats Take a few quick asides: R projects, factors, and R packages Read ‘clean’ delimited data Read Excel, SAS, &amp; SPSS data Resources for JSON data, XML data, databases, and APIs How to read in data depends on raw/external data type! We’ll start by focusing on delimited data. Delimiter - Character (such as a,) that separates data entries To read in data we’ll need functions to do so. When you open R a few packages are loaded. R Packages: Collection of functions/datasets/etc. in one place Packages exist to do almost anything List of CRAN approved packages on R’s website Plenty of other packages on places like GitHub The utils package that automatically loads has a family of read. functions ready for use! Reading data with these functions is often referred to as reading with a standard R or base R method. Function and purpose: Type of Delimeter Function Comma read.csv() Semicolon (, for decimal) read.csv2() Tab read.delim() White Space/General read.table(sep = \"\") Each of these functions requires a path to the file in order to read it in. Let’s read in the ‘neuralgia.csv’ file. This is a comma separated value file (.csv). This requires the read.csv function. R locates the file by the path you give it. You can give full path name. For example, ex: C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods/datasets/neuralgia.csv ex: C:\\\\Users\\\\jbpost2\\\\repos\\\\StatisticalMethods\\\\datasets\\\\neuralgia.csv Notice that a double \\ is needed because \\ is an escape character in R so \\\\ is really read as \\. Ok, let’s read in the neuralgia csv file using read.csv. neuralgiaData &lt;- read.csv( &quot;C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods/datasets/neuralgia.csv&quot; ) head(neuralgiaData) ## Treatment Sex Age Duration Pain ## 1 P F 68 1 No ## 2 B M 74 16 No ## 3 P F 67 30 No ## 4 P M 66 26 Yes ## 5 B F 67 28 No ## 6 B F 77 16 No Pretty simply if the data is nicely formatted! Using a full local path not recommended though! Doing so makes it difficult to share code without having to go in and change the paths. Instead, you can change the working directory R is using. That is, the folder by default R is ‘looking’ for files. Then we can supply a relative path. As long as other users have the same folder structure as you (say if you are using a github repo), no changes need to be made for them to run the code! We can determine the working directory using getwd. getwd() ## [1] &quot;C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods&quot; This can be changed using setwd. setwd(&quot;C:/Users/jbpost2/repos/StatisticalMethods/datasets&quot;) #or setwd(&quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\jbpost2\\\\repos\\\\StatisticalMethods\\\\datasets&quot;) The working directory can also be changed via the menus in RStudio. Another way to supply a path is via a URL. This is really handy if you have a place to host your datasets! neuralgiaData &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv&quot;) To recap, to read a csv file you can Use full local path (not recommended) Use relative path set working directory with setwd() Pull from a URL 24.4.13 Quick Aside: RStudio Project Often we have many files associated with an analysis. When working on multiple undertakings things get cluttered in R… With each analysis we may want to associate different + environments + histories + working directories + source documents The “Project” feature in R Studio allows us to easily do this! To create you can use the drop down menus. Now you can easily switch between analyses by using “File –&gt; Open Project” or by using the little drop down menu in the top right of RStudio. 24.4.14 Quick Aside: Factors As mentioned above there are read. functions for many different types of delimited data. These functions work really well but there are a few areas they could be improved. A poor default function behavior as strings are read as factors Understanding factors is important enough to warrant a quick discussion. Let’s look at the structure of our neuralgiaData object we read in with read.csv. str(neuralgiaData) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 60 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ Treatment: Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;P&quot;: 3 2 3 3 2 2 1 2 2 1 ... ## $ Sex : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;F&quot;,&quot;M&quot;: 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 ... ## $ Age : int 68 74 67 66 67 77 71 72 76 71 ... ## $ Duration : int 1 16 30 26 28 16 12 50 9 17 ... ## $ Pain : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;: 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 ... We can see that all of the character variables are Factor vectors. A factor is a special class of vector with a levels attribute. The levels define all possible values for that variable. This is a great concept for a variable that can only take on certain values such as Day (Monday, Tuesday, …, Sunday). However, if you have a variable like Name that you will eventually add new values (levels) to factors become a bit of a nuisance. For example, in the neuralgia dataset we may have a fourth treatment we want to add to the Treatment variable. Let’s try to assign the first observation value with a ‘new’ treatment called ‘M’. neuralgiaData$Treatment ## [1] P B P P B B A B B A A A B A P A P A P B B A A A B P B B P P A A B B B A P B ## [39] B P P P A B A P P A B P P P B A P A P A B A ## Levels: A B P neuralgiaData$Treatment[1] &lt;- &quot;M&quot; ## Warning in `[&lt;-.factor`(`*tmp*`, 1, value = structure(c(NA, 2L, 3L, 3L, : ## invalid factor level, NA generated We can see this throws an error because ‘M’ is not one of the levels defined for the variable. To add the new value we have to alter the levels attribute of the factor. #overwrite with another possible level levels(neuralgiaData$Treatment) &lt;- c(levels(neuralgiaData$Treatment), &quot;M&quot;) levels(neuralgiaData$Treatment) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;M&quot; neuralgiaData$Treatment[1] &lt;- &quot;M&quot; Factors are very useful for plotting as we’ll see later. For the other issues with the read. family we can look at useful functions from other R packages. R packages deserve a brief discussion as well! 24.4.15 Quick Aside: R Packages An R package is a collection of functions in one place. There are tons of packages to do most anything. In particular a group of packages called the “TidyVerse” has modernized the use of R for a larger audience. The tidyverse is a package that is a collection of eight R packages that share common philosophies and are designed to work together! One of these packages, readr, is extremely useful for reading in data and remedies the concerns mentioned above about the read. family of functions. The first time using a package you must ‘install’ the package (download the files). You can do this Using code: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) #can do multiple packages at once install.packages(c(&quot;readr&quot;, &quot;readxl&quot;, &quot;haven&quot;, &quot;DBI&quot;, &quot;httr&quot;)) Using menus: Note that you can also install packages from local sources (such as a downloaded .zip or .tar) but that isn’t usually required unless you are behind a firewall or R updates and the packages haven’t bene updated for that version of R. The good thing is that you only need to install the packages once! However, this doesn’t mean you have direct access to your package functions or datasets in your R session. Each R session you open you need to read in the package using library() or require(). library(&quot;readr&quot;) require(&quot;haven&quot;) These functions are very similar; they both give you direct access to the functions or data in your R session. The difference is that if you try to load a package that doesn’t exist library throws an error where require() returns FALSE. library(&quot;notAPackage&quot;) ## Error in library(&quot;notAPackage&quot;): there is no package called &#39;notAPackage&#39; require(&quot;notAPackage&quot;) ## Loading required package: notAPackage ## Warning in library(package, lib.loc = lib.loc, character.only = TRUE, ## logical.return = TRUE, : there is no package called &#39;notAPackage&#39; Now is a good time to install the tidyverse package if you haven’t already. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) The functions in the tidyverse generally have Fast code Easy syntax Good default settings on functions A nice set of examples and vignettes Read the package into your R session. library(tidyverse) You’ll likely see a message about functions being masked. This implies that one of the functions just loaded has a function under the same name as a function that already exists. If you type help(filter), R will now give you an option of which filter to look at. R uses the most recently loaded function and “masks” the old ones. You can access specific package’s functions using ::. This allows you to call functions without loading a full library. readr::read_csv(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## Treatment = col_character(), ## Sex = col_character(), ## Age = col_double(), ## Duration = col_double(), ## Pain = col_character() ## ) ## # A tibble: 60 x 5 ## Treatment Sex Age Duration Pain ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 P F 68 1 No ## 2 B M 74 16 No ## 3 P F 67 30 No ## 4 P M 66 26 Yes ## 5 B F 67 28 No ## # ... with 55 more rows 24.4.16 Reading Delimited Data Again the read. functions exist to read in many different types of delimited data. These functions work really well but there are a few areas they could be improved. A poor default function behavior as strings are read as factors Raw data row &amp; column names can be troublesome Slow processing (relatively speaking) (Slightly) different behavior on different computers Functions from the tidyverse (and readr in particular) remedy all of these! Type of Delimeter utils Function readr Comma read.csv() read_csv() Semicolon (, for decimal) read.csv2() read_csv2() Tab read.delim() read_tsv() General read.table(sep = \"\") read_delim() White Space read.table(sep = \"\") read_table() read_table2() Let’s reread the ‘neuralgia.csv’ file using read_csv from the readr package. neuralgiaData &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/neuralgia.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## Treatment = col_character(), ## Sex = col_character(), ## Age = col_double(), ## Duration = col_double(), ## Pain = col_character() ## ) You can see that the package displays a bit of information about how the data was parsed. neuralgiaData ## # A tibble: 60 x 5 ## Treatment Sex Age Duration Pain ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 P F 68 1 No ## 2 B M 74 16 No ## 3 P F 67 30 No ## 4 P M 66 26 Yes ## 5 B F 67 28 No ## # ... with 55 more rows You’ll also notice the fancy printing. This gives a quick check for the column type you have, which is a basic data validation step. The tidyverse has a special class of data frames called tibbles. class(neuralgiaData) ## [1] &quot;spec_tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; The behavior of tibbles is slightly different than that of a standard data frame. One is the printing method. The other major difference is that tibbles don’t simplify. neuralgiaData[,1] ## # A tibble: 60 x 1 ## Treatment ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 P ## 2 B ## 3 P ## 4 P ## 5 B ## # ... with 55 more rows as.data.frame(neuralgiaData)[,1] ## [1] &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [20] &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## [39] &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [58] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; As this behavior can cause some issues with functions that are expecting a vector it is useful to force simplification sometimes. You can either use the pull function or the $ operator to return a column as a vector. pull(neuralgiaData, 1) ## [1] &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [20] &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## [39] &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [58] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; neuralgiaData$Treatment ## [1] &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [20] &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## [39] &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;P&quot; ## [58] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; One question you may have about the column types is, how did R determine the column types? The help file for read_csv tells us that it checks the first 1000 rows of data and uses those to figure out the type of data. You can of course override this default behavior. Some useful inputs you may want to change when reading in data are skip = 0 col_names = TRUE na = c(\"\", \"NA\") These allow you to skip lines of data, specify column names, and define what represents a missing value in the raw data (NA is the missing data indicator in R). Generally, reading clean delimited data pretty easy with the read_ family of functions! Let’s go through a few examples. First, let’s read in the space delimited file ‘chemical.txt’. Since this is space delimited we’ll use read_table. read_table(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/chemical.txt&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## `temp conc time percent` = col_character() ## ) ## # A tibble: 19 x 1 ## `temp conc time percent` ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 -1 -1 -1 45.9 ## 2 1 -1 -1 60.6 ## 3 -1 1 -1 57.5 ## 4 1 1 -1 58.6 ## 5 -1 -1 1 53.3 ## 6 1 -1 1 58 ## 7 -1 1 1 58.8 ## 8 1 1 1 52.4 ## 9 -2 0 0 46.9 ## 10 2 0 0 55.4 ## 11 0 -2 0 55 ## 12 0 2 0 57.5 ## 13 0 0 -2 56.3 ## 14 0 0 2 58.9 ## 15 0 0 0 56.9 ## 16 2 -3 0 61.1 ## 17 2 -3 0 62.9 ## 18 -1.4 2.6 0.7 60 ## 19 -1.4 2.6 0.7 60.6 Next, let’s read in the tab delimited file ‘crabs.txt’. Since this is tab delimited we’ll use read_tsv. read_tsv(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/crabs.txt&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## color = col_double(), ## spine = col_double(), ## width = col_double(), ## satell = col_double(), ## weight = col_double(), ## y = col_double() ## ) ## # A tibble: 173 x 6 ## color spine width satell weight y ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3 3 28.3 8 3050 1 ## 2 4 3 22.5 0 1550 0 ## 3 2 1 26 9 2300 1 ## 4 4 3 24.8 0 2100 0 ## 5 4 3 26 4 2600 1 ## # ... with 168 more rows Lastly, let’s read in the &gt; delimited file ‘umps2012.txt’. As this isn’t a standard delimiter we’ll use read_delim and specify the delim = input. However, this file doesn’t contain column names in the raw data. The columns represent Year, Month, Day, Home, Away, and HPUmpire. The column names can be specified using the col_names input and specifying them with a character vector. read_delim(&quot;https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/umps2012.txt&quot;, delim = &quot;&gt;&quot;, col_names = c(&quot;Year&quot;, &quot;Month&quot;, &quot;Day&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Away&quot;, &quot;HPUmpire&quot;)) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## Year = col_double(), ## Month = col_double(), ## Day = col_double(), ## Home = col_character(), ## Away = col_character(), ## HPUmpire = col_character() ## ) ## # A tibble: 2,359 x 6 ## Year Month Day Home Away HPUmpire ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2012 4 12 MIN LAA D.J.

Type of file Package Function Delimited readr read_csv(), read_tsv(),read_table(), read_delim() Excel (.xls,.xlsx) readxl read_excel() SAS (.sas7bdat) haven read_sas() SPSS (.sav) haven read_spss() Let’s read in the censusEd.xlsx file.This can be done with the read_excel() from readxl package! This funcion reads in both xls and xlsx files. It detects the format from the file extension given in the path name. One issue is that excel files can be read from the web so they do need to be downloaded locally. #install package if necessary library(readxl) #reads first sheet by default edData &lt;- read_excel(&quot;datasets/censusEd.xlsx&quot;) edData ## # A tibble: 3,198 x 42 ## Area_name STCOU EDU010187F EDU010187D EDU010187N1 EDU010187N2 EDU010188F ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 UNITED S~ 00000 0 40024299 0000 0000 0 ## 2 ALABAMA 01000 0 733735 0000 0000 0 ## 3 Autauga,~ 01001 0 6829 0000 0000 0 ## 4 Baldwin,~ 01003 0 16417 0000 0000 0 ## 5 Barbour,~ 01005 0 5071 0000 0000 0 ## # ... with 3,193 more rows, and 35 more variables: EDU010188D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010188N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010188N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010189F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010189D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010189N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010189N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010190F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010190D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010190N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010190N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010191F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010191D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010191N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010191N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010192F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010192D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010192N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010192N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010193F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010193D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010193N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010193N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010194F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010194D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010194N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010194N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010195F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010195D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010195N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010195N2 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010196F &lt;dbl&gt;, EDU010196D &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # EDU010196N1 &lt;chr&gt;, EDU010196N2 &lt;chr&gt; If you want to read in a sheet other than the first sheet, you can do so with the sheet = argument. To look at the available sheets without opening in Excel you can use the excel_sheets function. excel_sheets(&quot;datasets/censusEd.xlsx&quot;) ## [1] &quot;EDU01A&quot; &quot;EDU01B&quot; &quot;EDU01C&quot; &quot;EDU01D&quot; &quot;EDU01E&quot; &quot;EDU01F&quot; &quot;EDU01G&quot; &quot;EDU01H&quot; ## [9] &quot;EDU01I&quot; &quot;EDU01J&quot; read_excel(&quot;datasets/censusEd.xlsx&quot;, sheet = &quot;EDU01D&quot;) There are also ways to specify which cells to read in with the range = argument.

Let’s read in the bodyFat.sav dataset. This can be done using the read_spss function from the haven package.

This data format is used widely across the internet and in databases. JSON data can represent our usual 2D data or heirarchical data. JSON uses key-value pairs. An example of raw JSON data is given below. { { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Barry Sanders&quot; &quot;games&quot; : 153 &quot;position&quot;: &quot;RB&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Joe Montana&quot; &quot;games&quot;: 192 &quot;position&quot;: &quot;QB&quot; } } There are three major R packages for reading in JSON data: rjson RJSONIO jsonlite We prefer jsonlite. It has many nice features to simplify reading in data, but these features do make the package’s functions a little slower. The most useful functions from jsonlite are summarized below: Function Description fromJSON Reads JSON data from file path or character string. Converts and simplfies to R object toJSON Writes R object to JSON object stream_in Accepts a file connection - can read streaming JSON data 24.4.21 XML XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. This is another data format that is used widely across the internet and in databases. This type of data can again represent our usual 2D data or heirarchical data. XML uss tags &lt; &gt; similar to HTML. An example of raw XML data is given below. &lt;roster&gt; &lt;player&gt; &lt;name&gt;Barry Sanders&lt;/name&gt; &lt;games&gt;153&lt;/games&gt; &lt;position&gt;RB&lt;/position&gt; &lt;/player&gt; &lt;player&gt; &lt;name&gt;Joe Montana&lt;/name&gt; &lt;games&gt;192&lt;/games&gt; &lt;position&gt;QB&lt;/position&gt; &lt;/player&gt; &lt;/roster&gt; The structure of the nodes has parent nodes, child nodes, etc. A basic diagram is given below. Figure 24.1: Source: mysamplecode.com There are two major R packages for reading in XML data: XML xml2 xml2 has all the basic functionality to get data into R. Reading XML data is generally tough since the structure of tags varies by data source! The xml2 core functions are: Function Description read_xml Accepts string, file path, or url argument. Returns XML data object xml_children Returns list of elements downstream from current node xml_parents Returns list of all parent elements from current node xml_contents Returns list of contents from current node as_list Converts XML document or node set to equivalent R list 24.4.22 Databases A database is a collection of data, usually a bunch of 2D tables that have keys that connect them. The Database Management System (DBMS) controls how users interact with the database. There is a common and very useful Structured Query Language (SQL - pronounced ess-que-el or sequel) used by relational database management systems (RDBMS) for retrieving and combining datasets from a database. An example of a relational database structure is given below. Notice there are keys that link different tables. Figure 24.2: Source: oreilly.com There are many popular RDBMS. Some are free and some are proprietary. These are often simply referred to as databases. Oracle - most popular (cross platform) SQL Server - Microsoft product DB2 - IBM product MySQL (open source) - Not as many features but popular PostgreSQL (open source) Again there is a Basic SQL language that is constant across all these database types. The common flow to connect to a database using R is: Connect to the database with DBI::dbConnect() Need appropriate R package for database backend RSQLite::SQLite() for RSQLite RMySQL::MySQL() for RMySQL RPostgreSQL::PostgreSQL() for RPostgreSQL odbc::odbc() for Open Database Connectivity bigrquery::bigquery() for google’s bigQuery con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), host = &quot;hostname.website&quot;, user = &quot;username&quot;, password = rstudioapi::askForPassword(&quot;DB password&quot;) ) Use tbl() to reference a table in the database tbl(con, &quot;name_of_table&quot;) Query the database with SQL or dplyr/dbplyr There is much more about R Studio and Databases here. 24.4.23 APIs API stands for Application Programming Interfaces. This is essentially a defined method for asking for information from a computer. They are useful for getting data or allowing others to run a model you’ve built. There are many open APIs. They usually just require you to register and obtain a key. Once you have a key you simply need to construct the proper URL to return the information you want from the API. As a quick example we will query the Harry Potter database at https://www.potterapi.com/. There is a button on the top right where you can register and obtain a key. The documentation for returning Harry Potter spells states: + All routes need to be prefixed with https://www.potterapi.com/v1/ + GET request: /spells returns all spells + Key goes on the end This tells us how to construct the appropriate URL. The paste and paste0 functions are useful for combining strings (check their help). baseURL &lt;- &quot;https://www.potterapi.com/v1/&quot; value &lt;- &quot;spells?&quot; key &lt;- &quot;key=$2a$10$UMvDCH.93fa2KOjKbJYkOOPMNzdzQpJ0gMnVEtcHzW5Ic04HUmcsa&quot; URL &lt;- paste0(baseURL, value, key) URL ## [1] &quot;https://www.potterapi.com/v1/spells?key=$2a$10$UMvDCH.93fa2KOjKbJYkOOPMNzdzQpJ0gMnVEtcHzW5Ic04HUmcsa&quot; Now we use the RCurl package and the getURL function to ping the URL we just created. This will return the spell data set in JSON form as that is the default response format for this API. spellData &lt;- RCurl::getURL(URL) This is a reasonably large string of information so we can just look at the first 100 characters using the substr function. substr(spellData, 1, 100) ## [1] &quot;[{\\&quot;_id\\&quot;:\\&quot;5b74ebd5fb6fc0739646754c\\&quot;,\\&quot;spell\\&quot;:\\&quot;Aberto\\&quot;,\\&quot;type\\&quot;:\\&quot;Charm\\&quot;,\\&quot;effect\\&quot;:\\&quot;opens objects\\&quot;},{\\&quot;_id\\&quot;:&quot; To convert this to a data frame we can use the fromJSON function in the jsonlite package. tbl_df converts the dataframe to a tibble (for printing purposes). spellDataDF &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(spellData) tbl_df(spellDataDF) ## # A tibble: 151 x 5 ## `_id` spell type effect `__v` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 5b74ebd5fb6fc073964~ Aberto Charm opens objects NA ## 2 5b74ecfa3228320021a~ Accio Charm Summons an object 0 ## 3 5b74ed2f3228320021a~ Age Line Enchantm~ Hides things from younger~ 0 ## 4 5b74ed453228320021a~ Aguamenti Charm shoots water from wand 0 ## 5 5b74ed583228320021a~ Alarte Ascend~ Spell shoots things high in the~ 0 ## # ... with 146 more rows Of course constructing URLs like this yourself isn’t ideal. Languages like python have many packages to help you contact APIs without reading as much documentation. Unfortunately, R does not have a very mature collection of API packages. The article here discusses accessing APIs generically with R. The same website gives a list of APIs that you might consider. 24.4.24 Basics of SAS 24.4.25 Manipulating Data with SAS 24.4.26 Reading Data with SAS "]
