Data is ubiquitous in today’s society. Healthcare, marketing, history, biology, … basically every field has a quantitative aspect. The quality of data varies greatly from study to study. 2.1.1 Data from Experiments Some data comes from a well-designed experiment where a researcher uses sound principles to select units and conduct interventions. For example, a mechanical engineer wants to determine which variables influence overall gas mileage of a certain year and model of a car. Gas mileage would be referred to as the response variable for this study. After careful consideration, the engineer chooses to investigate a few explanatory variables. They looked at the following factors that they believed may affect the overall gas mileage: Tire pressure (low, standard) Octane rating of fuel (regular, midgrade, premium) Type of driving (defensive, aggressive) They also choose to control or hold constant the following variables during the implementation of the study: Weather conditions Route Tire type Past car usage The engineer randomly selects 24 cars from the assembly line for that year and model of car (we’ll learn more about the importance of selecting a representative sample of cars shortly). Software is used to randomly assign a treatment or combination of the factors to each car of the 24 cars. For instance, low tire pressure, regulare octane fuel, and defensive driving would be a treatement. The cars would be called the experimental units or (EUs) as they are the unit the treatments are assigned to. The experiment is run and the gas mileage found for each car. As the car is being measured we’d refer to the car as the observational unit. This short description exhibits three important concepts in experimental design that we’ll come back to many times. Experimental Study - researchers manipulate the conditions in which the study is done. Pillars of experimental design: (Put an outer block around this) Randomization - treatments are randomly assigned to the experimental units Replication - multiple (independent) experimental units are assigned the same treatment Control - study conditions are held constant where possible to reduce variability in the response 2.1.2 Data from Observational Studies Some data comes from an observational study where the researcher collects data without imposing any changes. For example, an economist wants to investigate the effects of recently added tariffs on agricultural products to the amount and value of such products that are traded between the United States and Asia. This study would have two response variables, amount and value of each product traded between the two parties. In order to take into account season variation and time of year, the economist decides to compare the two response variables from the current year - 6 months worth of data - to the average values of the two response variables during the same 6 month periods for the past 5 years. We would refer to the time frame of the data as an explanatory variable. This time frame could be labeled to take on one of two values: no-tariff (past) or tariff (current). The researcher obtains the data from the census bureau and conducts their analysis. Notice that the researcher, while certainly being actively involved in the careful consideration of the data to be collected, does not actively intervene or impose a change. This is the key component of an observational study. Observational Study - researchers collects data without imposing any changes on the study environment. 2.1.3 Observational vs Experimental You may have noticed that both types of studies have some things in common. For instance, both studies have response (??? so I was thinking about maybe bolding most stats words as we go to point them out to students… thoughts???) variables that characterizes the performance of the study in some sense. Importantly, these response variables have variation. That is, observing the variable is non-deterministic even under identical situations. There are also explanatory variables that the researcher is interested in with regard to their relationship with the response variable. Beyond that, both studies hope to make conclusions about a larger group using data. This is the idea of statistical inference (??? Do we want to talk about the differences between prediction and inference here? - later???). More formally the group of values, items, or individuals defines the a population of interest and the data collected represents the sample. For the gas mileage example, the population would be all cars of the year and make in question and the sample would be the data on the 24 cars. For the tariff example, the population would be a conceptual population of all future agricultural products traded between the United States and Asia and the sample would be the information from the six years of trade data. Population - (Possibly conceptual) group of units of interest Sample - Subset of the population on which we observe data Statistical Inference - Process of using sample data to make statements or claims about a population (???Usually with the goal of determing which variables are important for a response???) Both of these studies had to determine how to obtain their observations. For the experiment, 24 cars were used. For the observational study, six years of data were collected. How this data is collected can be extremely important in terms of the types of conclusions that can be made. Data needs to be unbiased and representative of the population in which the researcher hopes to make inference otherwise the conclusions made are likely invalid. We’ll discuss the idea of what makes a good and bad sampling scheme later. The major difference between the two studies was the active (experimental) and passive (observational) roles played by the researcher. This difference is also of vital importance to the types of conclusions that can be made from the study. A well-designed experiment can often infer causation to the treatments where an observational study cannot. The conclusions a researcher can make based on how the data were collected and the type of study are outlined in the table below. (??? Probably just remake this table ourselves with our own words. This isn’t exactly ‘their’ original thought or something we need to attribute. ???) Figure 2.1: Scope of Inference, cite: Khan Academy Doing an observational study doesn’t mean that your study is bad! An observational study is sometimes done out of necessity when an experiment wouldn’t be ethical or feasible. For the tariff example, there really isn’t a way to conduct an experiment. If we wanted to design an experiment to see if smoking causes lung cancer, that would be unethical because we can’t force people to smoke. The key point is that the implications we can draw will differ greatly between experimental and observational studies and will depend heavily on the quality (in relation to the population) of the data you have. 2.1.4 The Role of Statistics Statistics is the science of learning from data. It encompasses the collection of data, the design of an experiment, the summarization of data, and the modeling or analysis used in order to make a decision or further scientific knowledge. (???I feel like this definition doesn’t quite get the sampling part right or maybe the holistic process or something - update as needed! JP???) (This will be changed to a different style of callout - maybe “note”?) Statistics in every day use usually refers to simply summaries about data (means/averages, proportions, or counts). Statistics as a field encompasses a much larger range of ideas including how to collect data, model data, and make decisions or come to conclusions when faced with uncertainty. Statistical methods are needed because data is variable. If we again collected data about the gas mileage of vehicles under the exact same study conditions we’ll get slightly different results. If we observed another six month period of trade data we’ll see different amounts and values. Accounting for this variability in data is a key component of a statistical analysis. Generally, one should try to take a holistic view of a study. Before any data is collected it is vital to understand the goals and background of the study. These will inform the data you ideally want to collect as well as the data that you are able to collect - which may need to act as a proxy. A plan should be determined for the actual collection and storing of the data. The entire study design will then inform the statistical analysis and conclusions that can be drawn. Taking this bigger picture view of the problem, we can usually follow these steps (we’ll try to follow these throughout the book!): Define the objective of the experiment and understand the background (Define Objective &amp; Background) Select appropriate response variables (Select Response) Identify sources of variation (Determine Sources of Variation) Choose sampling scheme and/or experimental design (Select Design) Carry out the study (Do Study) Statistically analyze the data (Do Statistical Analysis) Draw conclusions from the analysis while considering limitations and the steps above as well as communicate results (Draw Conclusions &amp; Communicate) We’ll focus on this entire process in our big chapter examples and mostly investigate designed experiments. We attempt to tackle each topic in this text with a problem-based approach. That is, we identify a real-world problem and discuss the relevant statistical ideas in context. At the end of each chapter we provide a recap the main statistical ideas and discuss other important related topics. Where applicable we include a section that outlines some of the mathematical concepts as well as a section to outline software related to the topic. 2.2 Observational Study - Farmer’s Market 2.2.1 Define Objective &amp; Background A nutrition scientist wanted to understand the cleanliness and food hygiene of the vendors at the North Carolina State Farmer’s Market (henceforth the farmer’s market). Secondarily, she wanted to learn about their sales to see if there was a relationship with their cleanliness and food hygiene. The researcher had access to the names of each vendor’s business, their general purpose, and the products they sold. Generally, there were three types of businesses classified as follows: Horticultural Crops Dairy Green Industry The researcher needed to decide the scope of their study. Formally, they needed to define the population of interest. The population is the group of people or units of interest to the researcher. In this case the population was all of the vendor’s at the farmer’s market other than the restaurants. One could try to do a study at just the North Carolina State Farmer’s Market and extend the results to all farmer’s market in the state or in the south, but that would require many assumptions to be valid. 2.2.2 Select Response The researchers needed to determine the variables to collect that would best help to answer their questions of interest. These variables that characterize the experiment are called response or target variables. They decided to collect vendors sales by looking at the (AMT) amount sold per week over the past two years (in dollars), the (PURCHASE) total number of purchases each week over the past two years, and the (NUM_ITEMS) total number of items sold per week over the past two years. For the last variable they had to decide how to measure the number of items sold for the different types of businesses. For vendors that mainly sold produce they decided to collect the total weight (in lbs) sold, for the live plant selling … To investigate the knowledge of hygiene and safety, a short questionnaire was developed to allow the vendor’s head manager (or similar employee) to self evaluate as well as answer some general questions developed around proper policy. You can see that there are many decisions that the researcher must make in simply deciding the response variables to collect! A poor choice here can make or break a study. 2.2.3 Determine Sources of Variation The response variables clearly have some relationship to other variables that could be collected. For instance, the NUM_ITEMS variable is clearly going to be different for the different types of vendors. The AMT variable would differ depending on the size of the vendor’s inventory. These are examples of explanatory variables or variables that define the study conditions. Explanatory variables go by many names such as predictors, features, or independent variables. A main consideration about whether or not to record a variable is whether or not the variable would be related to a variation in the response. Since the response variables are truly what is of interest, there is really not much of a point in recording variables that likely have no relationship with it. Choosing the explanatory variables can also indicate further questions of interest. We may want to compare the average AMT for vendors that mainly sell vegetables to those that mainly sell fruit leading to a comparison across groups being of interest. The average amount for the population or a subpopulation would be referred to as a parameter of interest. Formally, a parameter is a summary measure about a population. Common parameters investigated include a mean, proportion, median, or variance of different subgroups of the population. 2.2.4 Select Design For this study the researchers aren’t interested in doing an intervention so an observational study was being done. The major task to consider for the observational study is how to select participants from the population. The subset of the population we (attempt to) observe our data on is called the sample. The sample size is the number of measurements in the sample. Ideally we would measure every member of our population. This is called a census. If a census can be done then values of a population’s parameters can be found exactly by simply summarizing the population data. However, conducting a census can be extremely costly or time instensive so most of the time a census cannot be done. This means that the information we collect would likely be different if we collected it again. Accounting for this variability is the main reason statistical analysis is needed. How the researcher selects their sample is extremely important. This method is often referred to as the sampling scheme. Using a statistically valid sampling scheme is vital to the assumptions made when doing statistical inference. A valid sampling scheme implies that every member of the population has a known and non-zero chance of inclusion in the sample. There are many good ways to select the sample and many bad ways. (Talk about bad first and why bad - visuals too) Talk about good and why good - visuals too. Here they chose to do a stratified sample to make sure that they didn’t leave out any important subgroups. 2.2.5 Do Study Go and talk to chosen vendors. May have some non-response issues. Ideally a contingency for this should be developed when considering the sampling scheme. 2.2.6 Do Statistical Analysis The major goals of this study were simply to describe the vendors at the farmer’s market. In this case we can produce numerical and graphical summaries. Careful discussion of not selecting a modeling technique based on this unless it is a pilot study or an exploratory study else we have increased our nominal type I error rate… Spend a lot of time here talking about graphs of different types. Sample means, sample variances, etc. Discuss population curves vs sample histograms and the relationship. Not a formal test here but comparisons of interest etc. 2.2.7 Draw Conclusions &amp; Communicate What actionable things have we found? Likely some trends to investigate further. Perhaps run an experiment to formally see if some alteration can be effective. What can we conclude realistically from this data? To what population are we talking? 2.3 Statistical Testing Ideas 2.3.1 Experiment Background This example would lend itself to a reasonably easy randomization test or simulation based test. Maybe an AB type study where we swap labels and do that with a nice visual. Maybe third example with simulation test. 2.3.2 Selecting Response Variables 2.3.3 Identifying Sources of Variation 2.3.4 Choose an Experimental Design Good discussion of what makes a good sampling design. Maybe a statified example like the river and selecting houses example as a quick expose of the issues with not doing a truly random sampling technique. Basics of experimental design (randomization, replication, error control ideas). Recap benefits of doing an experiment vs an observational study. 2.3.5 Peform the Test 2.3.6 Explore the Data NHST paradigm with false discovery? 2.3.7 Statistically Analyze the Data 2.3.8 Draw conclusions The implications for the conclusions that can be made from a set of data varies greatly with the quality of the data and study design. 2.4 Why Observational Studies Can be Bad?

The engineer responsible for the new desing needs to make sure that the packaging fits the new cookies. While the cookie manufacturing process is standardized, there’s inevitably some degree of variation in cookie size. After discussing the issue with corporate, the engineer decides that a the new cookie sleeves should be large enough to fit 95% of cookies that are baked. (The largest five percent will be marketed separately as “JUMBO” cookies.) 3.2.2 Define the object of the experiment The Engineer is tasked with determining how large the cooke sleeve needs to be. There’s no way for her to know the size of every cookie that Big Deborah’s has made (or will make going forward!), so she’ll need to collect data on existing cookies to inform her cookie sleeve size determination. 3.2.3 Select appropriate response variables If the maximum distance from any one point on the (round) cookie’s perimeter to any other point is smaller than the diameter of the cookie sleeve, then the cookie will fit. This makes “cookie diameter” a good measure for this test. It is easy to measure for each cookie and is directly relevant to the experiment’s objective. [probably have something in here about ] 3.2.4 IDentify sources of variation While the manufacturing process is standardized, there is variation in size from one cookie to the next. This is one source of variation. The engineer isn’t sure of any others. However, she knows that cookies are made in multiple factories, and that each factory has multiple ovens. Ovens and factories could also be sources of variation. 3.2.5 Choose an experimental design The Engineer knows that she needs to look at multiple cookies, since she knows that there is variation in diameter from one cookie to the next. One option would be to just use the remaining cookies in the box she has in her office (22 of the 25-count box remain). [something about convenience sample] However, she knows that cookies from the same oven are typically packaged together. If there is variation from one oven to the next, looking at the cookies she has in her office may not tell the whole story. Instead, she chooses to take every 20th cookie manufactured off the assembly line until she gets 500 cookies. [something about systematic sample] 3.2.6 Perform the test The day of the test comes, and the Engineer starts collecting cookies. However, problems arise! The plan has to shut down half-way through, so she only gets 431 cookies instead of the 500 she thought she would. However, she measures the diameters of each cookie and records the data in a spreadsheet. 3.2.7 Statistically analyze the data The initial plan had been to rank-order the 500 cookies and estimate the 95th percentile using the diamter of the 475th largets cookie. Since we didn’t get all of our data, we have to improvise. 431 doesn’t neatly yield a value such that exactly 95% are less than or equal and 5% are greater than or equal. One option is to choose the 410th largest cookie to estimate our percentile. Slightly more than 95% of cookies will have smaller diameters than this. Alternatively, we could interpolate between the 409th and 410th cookies. [reasons and logic and math for each of these] 3.2.8 Draw conclusions Based on this study, the Engineer concludes that a cookie sleeve large enough for a cookie of diameter XX will be big enough to contain 95% of Big Deborah cookies. 3.2.9 Discussion pros and cons to the approach chosen generalizing to other types of point estimates "],

["HT.html", "Chapter 5 Inference via Hypothesis Tests for One Sample 5.1 Example: Detection Probability 5.2 Marketing Example 5.3 Statistical Testing Ideas", " Chapter 5 Inference via Hypothesis Tests for One Sample 5.1 Example: Detection Probability An important problem for the US Army is protecting soldiers in forward positions. One of main threats to these soldiers are explosive projectiles launched from great distances. These are often refered to as “indirect fires”, since the folks launching the projectiles (“firing” the projectiles) may not have direct visibility (“line of sight”) to their target. For example, artillery like the US M777 Light Towed Howitzer can fire projectiles over 40 km, far beyond the distance a soldier operating the machine could aim it. Instead, the gun crew relies on information about where to shoot provided to them by other units on the battlefield. This allows them to effect the battle from far away and without alerting their target. To protect soldiers from similar threats, the US Army developed the Q-53 Counterfire Radar. One of this system’s primary functions is to detect incoming indirect fires and pinpoint the source of those shots. Because soliders will be relying on the Q-53 in combat, the US Government tested it extensively to better understand how it would perform in an operational setting. The testers fired shells from systems that closely resembled the artillery that might be seen on the battlefield while actual soldiers operated a Q-53. For each shell that was fired, the testers recorded whether or not the Q-53 crew was able to detect the projectile with their system. Using data from this test, evaluators were able to the likelihood that the Q-53 would detect an incoming projectile. 5.1.1 Understanding system performance Let’s take a step back and consider the data we’re getting from this test and try to understand why the testers did things the way they did. First, let’s consider the goal of this test. At the end of the day, the US Army wants to know how effective the Q-53 is at it’s job. This job is to help protect soldiers by giving them early warning if they’re under attack from indirect fires like artillery. Therefore, it’s vital that the Q-53 detect incoming projectiles with high probability. Once we understand this, the choice to measure the detection probability for incoming projectiles is completley logical. This measure ties directly to the goal of the experiment. You won’t always be able to find a response variable that ties so directly to the goal of your test, but when you do, rejoice. There are some other measures the testers could’ve used. For example, they could’ve looked at how long a projectile was detected prior to its impact on the target. Similarly, they could’ve measured the distance from the target at time of detection. Both of these measures would give more detailed information than detection alone. However, they’d be harder to measure precisely. Addiing additional instrumentation to the Q-53 and to the test projectiles being fired at the range would add elements to the experiment that would make it less realistic. Perhaps instrumenting the projectiles would make them easier to detect. Regardless, the testers deemed the detection probability adequate to make their assessment of the system. 5.1.2 Data Analysis Having identified their response variable, the testers collected data on which projectils were detected. Table 1 shows the first 20 shots collected. x &lt;- rbinom(20, 1, .8) hist(x) It’s clear that the system detects these projectiles with a high probability, but what conclusions can we draw from 5.1.3 Data from Experiments Some data comes from a well-designed experiment where a researcher uses sound principles to select units and conduct interventions. For example, a mechanical engineer wants to determine which variables influence overall gas mileage of a certain year and model of a car.

Summaries at the end of each chapter recap the main statistical ideas. 5.2 Marketing Example 5.2.1 Experiment Background Marketing example. Goal to describe the customers, how they tend to purchase/shop, and maybe find some shared qualities in order to adverstise curated packages to folks. Define basic things like population, parameters, statistics, and sample. Discuss conceptual vs actual populations and when we might care about one or the other. Our “sample” is really a bit of data from the conceptual population. Or we could consider it as the population and we just want to describe it. 5.2.2 Selecting Response Variables We don’t get to choose the variables here as the analytics company gives us what they deem important. We can however still think critically about what is important. Marketing example with data such as Clicks, Impressions, Total Revenue, Total Spent, Average Order Value, Sport, Time of visit/purchase, Campaigns running, etc. 5.2.3 Identifying Sources of Variation Consider variables linked to the user. Age, other accounts, etc. 5.2.4 Choose an Experimental Design Discuss our “sampling” scheme vs a random sample. This seems like a case where we aren’t doing a “good” scheme but not much else could be done… Maybe talk about how in the future you could do alternate email ads or something and do an AB type study. 5.2.5 Peform the Test Get the data from google analytics or whatever, have a plan for updating each month? 5.2.6 Look at the Data Careful discussion of not selecting a modeling technique based on this unless it is a pilot study or an exploratory study else we have increased our nominal type I error rate… (sometimes EDA sometimes data validation only/cleaning - more formal experiments) Spend a lot of time here talking about graphs of different types.

["motivating-example.html", "Chapter 9 Motivating example", " Chapter 9 Motivating example The United States Air Force Academy has 24 sections of Calculus I, taught by three different types of instructors: In-uniform instructors, full-time civilian instructors, and visiting faculty. The Dean of Students wants to give students the best experience possible and make sure that all three types of instructors are doing a good job. There are plausible reasons why any one of the three could be doing well: In-uniform instructors are all members of the Air Force, and students may be extra attention in these classes because they know that these instructors rank above them in their chain of command. On the other hand, full-time instructors have been aroudn the Academy for many years and understand the Cadets and their workloads. Alternatively, visiting facutly tend to come from prestigeous institutions and may be familiar with more recently-developed pedagogical techniques. Regardless, the Dean wants to understand if there is any variation in end-of-semester grades of classes taught by these three types of instructors. At the end of the semester, she collects the average grades from each of the 24 sections. How can she go about investigating this question? Recall from Chapter 6 that we can use t-tests to compare two group means. In this case, we’d like to do a comparison across three groups, and instead of looking at a direct comparison of one group to another, what the Dean is interested in is whether there’s an overall difference across the three groups. One option might be to just do a bunch of different t-tests. We could first compare classes taught by in-uniform instructors to classes taught by full-time civilians, then compare the classes taught by the in-uniform instructors to the classes taugth by the visiting instructors, and then finally compare the classes taugth by the full-time civilains with the classes taught by the visiting facutly. We’d end up with three p-values, each addressing different questions than the one we initially set out to answer. We could do the same thing, except comparing courses taught by one type of instructor to the combined group of courses taught by the other two, and this gets a bit closer to the mark. But we’re still doing three tests that individually fail to answer the Dean’s question. What we’d like instead is a single hypothesis that we could test that direclty gets at the Dean’s concern about whether the three types of instructors were producing end-of-semester grades that were, on average, the same. [Need to make that motivation clearer above.] "],

["notation.html", "Chapter 24 Appendix - Notation 24.1 Standard notation 24.2 Mixed models 24.3 Effects model representation 24.4 Estimators vs. Estimates", " Chapter 24 Appendix - Notation 24.1 Standard notation Vectors of variables are denoted with Roman letters, such as \\(x\\) and \\(Y\\). Capital letters denote random variables while lower case letters denote fixed variables. Note that these vectors may be of length 1 depending on context. Bolded values (\\(x\\)) denote matrices, and in the case of \\(Y\\), possibly single-column matrices. Unknown parameters are denoted with Greek letters, with boldface font indicating matrices. In most models, \\(Y\\) will denote the univariate response, \\(x\\) will describe a matrix of predictor variables, and \\(E\\) a vector of random errors. The Greek letter \\(\\beta\\) will be commonly used for regression parameters (either with subscripts for each values as in \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1\\) or as a vector (as in \\(X\\beta\\)). The letters \\(i, j, k,\\) and \\(l\\) will be most commonly used as subscripts or indices. \\(N\\) will typically denote a sample size (not a random vector), with subscripted versions (\\(n_i\\)) describing the number of observations in a group, and \\(p\\) describing the number of parameters in a model beyond the intercept. We may therefore describe a simple linear regresion model as: \\[Y = x\\beta + E\\] In this model, \\(Y\\) is a \\(N\\times 1\\) random vector, \\(x\\) is a \\(N\\times (p + 1)\\) matrix of fixed values, and \\(E\\) is a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector. \\(\\pi\\) is typically used to describe probability parameters, as in Bernoulli or binomial random variables. 24.2 Mixed models Still need to add something for this 24.3 Effects model representation In the effects formulation of ANOVA models, additional greek letters (\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\gamma\\), etc.) will appear as parameter effects, as will \\(\\mu\\), which will typically represent the grand mean. Group-specfic means will be denoted via subscripts: \\(\\mu_{ij}\\). When using this representation, it is convenient to describe a single observation as \\(Y_{ijk}\\), which is the \\(k\\)th observation from the group with with the \\(i\\)th level of the first factor and the \\(j\\)th level of the second factor. In the main effects version of this model, we have: \\[Y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\gamma_j + E_{ijk}\\] We can therefore estimate \\(\\mu_{ij}\\) as \\(\\hat \\mu_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k = 1}^n Y_{ijk} = \\bar{Y}_{ij\\cdot}\\). This “dot” notation can be extended to any subscript and indicates summing over the index that has been replaced by the dot. Further note that the “hat” over a paremeter value denotes the estimator for that parameter value, and the “bar” indicates an average. These features are used generally throughout this book. 24.4 Estimators vs. Estimates If we want to get pedantic, we can differentiate between estimates and estimators in our notation. Estimators are functions of random variables used to estimate parameters. Estimates are realized values of estimators. To differentiate these, we use Roman letters with hats to represent estimators (\\(\\hat B = (x&#39;x )^{-1}x&#39;Y\\)) and Greek letters with hats to represent estimates (\\(\\hat \\beta = 1.52\\)).
