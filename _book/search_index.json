Data is ubiquitous in today’s society. Healthcare, marketing, history, biology, … basically every field has a quantitative aspect. The quality of data varies greatly from study to study. Some data comes from a well-designed experiment where a researcher uses sound principles to select units and conduct interventions. For example, … &lt;&lt;Call out with designed experiment and the ‘pillars’ of design listed&gt;&gt; Other data comes from observations studies where … For example, … &lt;&gt; The implications for the conclusions that can be made from a set of data varies greatly with the quality of the data and study design. &lt;&gt; Statistics is the science of learning from data. &lt;&lt;call out about statistics, general usage vs this type of definition&gt;&gt; Statistical methods are needed because data is variable. For example… The full statistical process begins with … - Define the objective of the experiment - Select appropriate response variables - Identify sources of variation - Choose experimental design - Perform the test - Statistically analyze the data - Draw conclusions We’ll focus on the entire process of a study and mostly investigate designed experiments. We attempt to tackle each topioc in this text with a problem-based approach. That is, we identify a real-world problem and discuss the relevant statistical ideas in context. Summaries at the end of each chapter recap the main statistical ideas. 2.1.1 Experiment Background Marketing example. Goal to describe the customers, how they tend to purchase/shop, and maybe find some shared qualities in order to adverstise curated packages to folks. Define basic things like population, parameters, statistics, and sample. Discuss conceptual vs actual populations and when we might care about one or the other. Our “sample” is really a bit of data from the conceptual population. Or we could consider it as the population and we just want to describe it. 2.1.2 Selecting Response Variables Marketing example with data such as Clicks, Impressions, Total Revenue, Total Spent, Average Order Value, Sport, Time of visit/purchase, Campaigns running, etc. 2.1.3 Identifying Sources of Variation Consider variables linked to the user. Age, other accounts, etc. 2.1.4 Choose an Experimental Design Discuss our “sampling” scheme vs a random sample. This seems like a case where we aren’t doing a “good” scheme but not much else could be done… Maybe talk about how in the future you could do alternate email ads or something and do an AB type study. 2.1.5 Peform the Test Get the data from google analytics or whatever, have a plan for updating each month? 2.1.6 Look at the Data Careful discussion of not selecting a modeling technique based on this unless it is a pilot study or an exploratory study else we have increased our nominal type I error rate… (sometimes EDA sometimes data validation only/cleaning - more formal experiments) Spend a lot of time here talking about graphs of different types. Sample means, sample variances, etc. Discuss population curves vs sample histograms and the relationship. 2.1.7 Statistically Analyze the Data New variables as functions of old? Not a formal test here but comparisons of interest etc. 2.1.8 Draw conclusions What actionable things have we found? Likely some trends to investigate further. Perhaps run an experiment to formally see if some alteration can be effective. What can we conclude realistically from this data? To what population are we talking? 2.2 Statistical Testing Ideas 2.2.1 Experiment Background This example would lend itself to a reasonably easy randomization test or simulation based test. Maybe an AB type study where we swap labels and do that with a nice visual. Maybe third example with simulation test. 2.2.2 Selecting Response Variables 2.2.3 Identifying Sources of Variation 2.2.4 Choose an Experimental Design Good discussion of what makes a good sampling design. Maybe a statified example like the river and selecting houses example as a quick expose of the issues with not doing a truly random sampling technique. Basics of experimental design (randomization, replication, error control ideas). Recap benefits of doing an experiment vs an observational study. 2.2.5 Peform the Test 2.2.6 Explore the Data NHST paradigm with false discovery? 2.2.7 Statistically Analyze the Data 2.2.8 Draw conclusions "]
