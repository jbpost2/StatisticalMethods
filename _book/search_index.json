Data is ubiquitous in today’s society. Healthcare, marketing, history, biology, … basically every field has a quantitative aspect. The quality of data varies greatly from study to study. 2.1.1 Data from Experiments Some data comes from a well-designed experiment where a researcher uses sound principles to select units and conduct interventions. For example, a mechanical engineer wants to determine which variables influence overall gas mileage of a certain year and model of a car. Gas mileage would be referred to as the response variable for this study. After careful consideration, the engineer chooses to investigate the following factors that may affect the overall gas mileage: Tire pressure (low, standard) Octane rating of fuel (regular, midgrade, premium) Type of driving (defensive, aggressive) They also choose to control or hold constant the following variables during the implementation of the study: Weather conditions Route Tire type Past car usage The engineer randomly selects 24 cars from the assembly line for that year and model of car (we’ll learn more about the importance of selecting a representative sample of cars shortly). Software is used to randomly assign a treatment or combination of the factors to each car of the 24 cars. For instance, low tire pressure, regulare octane fuel, and defensive driving would be a treatement. The cars would be called the experimental units or (EUs) as they are the unit the treatments are assigned to. The experiment is run and the gas mileage found for each car. As the car is being measured we’d refer to the car as the observational unit. This short description exhibits three important concepts in experimental design that we’ll come back to many times. Experiment - researchers manipulate the conditions in which the study is done. Pillars of experimental design: Randomization - treatments are randomly assigned to the experimental units Replication - multiple (independent) experimental units are assigned the same treatment Control - study conditions are held constant where possible to reduce variability in the response 2.1.2 Data from Observational Studies Other data comes from observations studies where … For example, … &lt;&gt; The implications for the conclusions that can be made from a set of data varies greatly with the quality of the data and study design. &lt;&gt; Both studies have some things in common - popu sample… Statistics is the science of learning from data. (Other definition from some book but not sure which - the science of designing studies or experiments, collecting data and modeling/analyzing data for the purpose of decisions making and scientific discovery when the available information is both limited and variable.) &lt;&lt;call out about statistics, general usage vs this type of definition&gt;&gt; Statistical methods are needed because data is variable. For example… The full statistical process begins with … - Define the objective of the experiment - Select appropriate response variables - Identify sources of variation - Choose experimental design - Perform the test - Statistically analyze the data - Draw conclusions We’ll focus on the entire process of a study and mostly investigate designed experiments. We attempt to tackle each topioc in this text with a problem-based approach. That is, we identify a real-world problem and discuss the relevant statistical ideas in context. Summaries at the end of each chapter recap the main statistical ideas. 2.1.3 Experiment Background Marketing example. Goal to describe the customers, how they tend to purchase/shop, and maybe find some shared qualities in order to adverstise curated packages to folks. Define basic things like population, parameters, statistics, and sample. Discuss conceptual vs actual populations and when we might care about one or the other. Our “sample” is really a bit of data from the conceptual population. Or we could consider it as the population and we just want to describe it. 2.1.4 Selecting Response Variables Marketing example with data such as Clicks, Impressions, Total Revenue, Total Spent, Average Order Value, Sport, Time of visit/purchase, Campaigns running, etc. 2.1.5 Identifying Sources of Variation Consider variables linked to the user. Age, other accounts, etc. 2.1.6 Choose an Experimental Design Discuss our “sampling” scheme vs a random sample. This seems like a case where we aren’t doing a “good” scheme but not much else could be done… Maybe talk about how in the future you could do alternate email ads or something and do an AB type study. 2.1.7 Peform the Test Get the data from google analytics or whatever, have a plan for updating each month? 2.1.8 Look at the Data Careful discussion of not selecting a modeling technique based on this unless it is a pilot study or an exploratory study else we have increased our nominal type I error rate… (sometimes EDA sometimes data validation only/cleaning - more formal experiments) Spend a lot of time here talking about graphs of different types. Sample means, sample variances, etc. Discuss population curves vs sample histograms and the relationship. 2.1.9 Statistically Analyze the Data New variables as functions of old? Not a formal test here but comparisons of interest etc. 2.1.10 Draw conclusions What actionable things have we found? Likely some trends to investigate further. Perhaps run an experiment to formally see if some alteration can be effective. What can we conclude realistically from this data? To what population are we talking? 2.2 Statistical Testing Ideas 2.2.1 Experiment Background This example would lend itself to a reasonably easy randomization test or simulation based test. Maybe an AB type study where we swap labels and do that with a nice visual. Maybe third example with simulation test. 2.2.2 Selecting Response Variables 2.2.3 Identifying Sources of Variation 2.2.4 Choose an Experimental Design Good discussion of what makes a good sampling design. Maybe a statified example like the river and selecting houses example as a quick expose of the issues with not doing a truly random sampling technique. Basics of experimental design (randomization, replication, error control ideas). Recap benefits of doing an experiment vs an observational study. 2.2.5 Peform the Test 2.2.6 Explore the Data NHST paradigm with false discovery? 2.2.7 Statistically Analyze the Data 2.2.8 Draw conclusions "],

The engineer responsible for the new desing needs to make sure that the packaging fits the new cookies. While the cookie manufacturing process is standardized, there’s inevitably some degree of variation in cookie size. After discussing the issue with corporate, the engineer decides that a the new cookie sleeves should be large enough to fit 95% of cookies that are baked. (The largest five percent will be marketed separately as “JUMBO” cookies.) 3.2.2 Define the object of the experiment The Engineer is tasked with determining how large the cooke sleeve needs to be. There’s no way for her to know the size of every cookie that Big Deborah’s has made (or will make going forward!), so she’ll need to collect data on existing cookies to inform her cookie sleeve size determination. 3.2.3 Select appropriate response variables If the maximum distance from any one point on the (round) cookie’s perimeter to any other point is smaller than the diameter of the cookie sleeve, then the cookie will fit. This makes “cookie diameter” a good measure for this test. It is easy to measure for each cookie and is directly relevant to the experiment’s objective. [probably have something in here about ] 3.2.4 IDentify sources of variation While the manufacturing process is standardized, there is variation in size from one cookie to the next. This is one source of variation. The engineer isn’t sure of any others. However, she knows that cookies are made in multiple factories, and that each factory has multiple ovens. Ovens and factories could also be sources of variation. 3.2.5 Choose an experimental design The Engineer knows that she needs to look at multiple cookies, since she knows that there is variation in diameter from one cookie to the next. One option would be to just use the remaining cookies in the box she has in her office (22 of the 25-count box remain). [something about convenience sample] However, she knows that cookies from the same oven are typically packaged together. If there is variation from one oven to the next, looking at the cookies she has in her office may not tell the whole story. Instead, she chooses to take every 20th cookie manufactured off the assembly line until she gets 500 cookies. [something about systematic sample] 3.2.6 Perform the test The day of the test comes, and the Engineer starts collecting cookies. However, problems arise! The plan has to shut down half-way through, so she only gets 431 cookies instead of the 500 she thought she would. However, she measures the diameters of each cookie and records the data in a spreadsheet. 3.2.7 Statistically analyze the data The initial plan had been to rank-order the 500 cookies and estimate the 95th percentile using the diamter of the 475th largets cookie. Since we didn’t get all of our data, we have to improvise. 431 doesn’t neatly yield a value such that exactly 95% are less than or equal and 5% are greater than or equal. One option is to choose the 410th largest cookie to estimate our percentile. Slightly more than 95% of cookies will have smaller diameters than this. Alternatively, we could interpolate between the 409th and 410th cookies. [reasons and logic and math for each of these] 3.2.8 Draw conclusions Based on this study, the Engineer concludes that a cookie sleeve large enough for a cookie of diameter XX will be big enough to contain 95% of Big Deborah cookies. 3.2.9 Discussion pros and cons to the approach chosen generalizing to other types of point estimates "],

["motivating-example.html", "Chapter 9 Motivating example", " Chapter 9 Motivating example The United States Air Force Academy has 24 sections of Calculus I, taught by three different types of instructors: In-uniform instructors, full-time civilian instructors, and visiting faculty. The Dean of Students wants to give students the best experience possible and make sure that all three types of instructors are doing a good job. There are plausible reasons why any one of the three could be doing well: In-uniform instructors are all members of the Air Force, and students may be extra attention in these classes because they know that these instructors rank above them in their chain of command. On the other hand, full-time instructors have been aroudn the Academy for many years and understand the Cadets and their workloads. Alternatively, visiting facutly tend to come from prestigeous institutions and may be familiar with more recently-developed pedagogical techniques. Regardless, the Dean wants to understand if there is any variation in end-of-semester grades of classes taught by these three types of instructors. At the end of the semester, she collects the average grades from each of the 24 sections. How can she go about investigating this question? Recall from Chapter 6 that we can use t-tests to compare two group means. In this case, we’d like to do a comparison across three groups, and instead of looking at a direct comparison of one group to another, what the Dean is interested in is whether there’s an overall difference across the three groups. One option might be to just do a bunch of different t-tests. We could first compare classes taught by in-uniform instructors to classes taught by full-time civilians, then compare the classes taught by the in-uniform instructors to the classes taugth by the visiting instructors, and then finally compare the classes taugth by the full-time civilains with the classes taught by the visiting facutly. We’d end up with three p-values, each addressing different questions than the one we initially set out to answer. We could do the same thing, except comparing courses taught by one type of instructor to the combined group of courses taught by the other two, and this gets a bit closer to the mark. But we’re still doing three tests that individually fail to answer the Dean’s question. What we’d like instead is a single hypothesis that we could test that direclty gets at the Dean’s concern about whether the three types of instructors were producing end-of-semester grades that were, on average, the same. [Need to make that motivation clearer above.] "],

["notation.html", "Chapter 24 Appendix - Notation 24.1 Standard notation 24.2 Mixed models 24.3 Effects model representation 24.4 Estimators vs. Estimates", " Chapter 24 Appendix - Notation 24.1 Standard notation Vectors of variables are denoted with Roman letters, such as \\(x\\) and \\(Y\\). Capital letters denote random variables while lower case letters denote fixed variables. Note that these vectors may be of length 1 depending on context. Bolded values (\\(x\\)) denote matrices, and in the case of \\(Y\\), possibly single-column matrices. Unknown parameters are denoted with Greek letters, with boldface font indicating matrices. In most models, \\(Y\\) will denote the univariate response, \\(x\\) will describe a matrix of predictor variables, and \\(E\\) a vector of random errors. The Greek letter \\(\\beta\\) will be commonly used for regression parameters (either with subscripts for each values as in \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1\\) or as a vector (as in \\(X\\beta\\)). The letters \\(i, j, k,\\) and \\(l\\) will be most commonly used as subscripts or indices. \\(N\\) will typically denote a sample size (not a random vector), with subscripted versions (\\(n_i\\)) describing the number of observations in a group, and \\(p\\) describing the number of parameters in a model beyond the intercept. We may therefore describe a simple linear regresion model as: \\[Y = x\\beta + E\\] In this model, \\(Y\\) is a \\(N\\times 1\\) random vector, \\(x\\) is a \\(N\\times (p + 1)\\) matrix of fixed values, and \\(E\\) is a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector. \\(\\pi\\) is typically used to describe probability parameters, as in Bernoulli or binomial random variables. 24.2 Mixed models Still need to add something for this 24.3 Effects model representation In the effects formulation of ANOVA models, additional greek letters (\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\gamma\\), etc.) will appear as parameter effects, as will \\(\\mu\\), which will typically represent the grand mean. Group-specfic means will be denoted via subscripts: \\(\\mu_{ij}\\). When using this representation, it is convenient to describe a single observation as \\(Y_{ijk}\\), which is the \\(k\\)th observation from the group with with the \\(i\\)th level of the first factor and the \\(j\\)th level of the second factor. In the main effects version of this model, we have: \\[Y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\gamma_j + E_{ijk}\\] We can therefore estimate \\(\\mu_{ij}\\) as \\(\\hat \\mu_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k = 1}^n Y_{ijk} = \\bar{Y}_{ij\\cdot}\\). This “dot” notation can be extended to any subscript and indicates summing over the index that has been replaced by the dot. Further note that the “hat” over a paremeter value denotes the estimator for that parameter value, and the “bar” indicates an average. These features are used generally throughout this book. 24.4 Estimators vs. Estimates If we want to get pedantic, we can differentiate between estimates and estimators in our notation. Estimators are functions of random variables used to estimate parameters. Estimates are realized values of estimators. To differentiate these, we use Roman letters with hats to represent estimators (\\(\\hat B = (x&#39;x )^{-1}x&#39;Y\\)) and Greek letters with hats to represent estimates (\\(\\hat \\beta = 1.52\\)).
