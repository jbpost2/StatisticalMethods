<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Data in the Wild</h2>
<p>Data is a collection of information about a group of individuals or units. Most often we have a number of variables, or measures of interest, that we observe on each individual or unit. The collection of information is called a dataset. Data is ubiquitous in today’s society. Healthcare, marketing, history, biology, … almost every field has data for which a sound statistical analysis can glean useful insights. However, the quality of data varies greatly from study to study and this implies the conclusions which you can draw from a study vary as well. Let’s jump in!</p>
<p>(<strong>Put visual of a dataset here</strong>)</p>
<div id="experimental-study" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Experimental Study</h3>
<p>Some data comes from a well-designed experiment where a researcher uses sound principles to select units for the study and conduct interventions.</p>
<p>For example, a mechanical engineer wanted to determine which variables influence gas mileage of a certain year and model of a car. Gas mileage would be referred to as the <strong>response</strong> variable for this study since it characterized the performance of interest.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, the engineer chose to investigate a few <strong>explanatory variables</strong> they believed were associated with the response. They wanted to learn about the relationship between gas mileage and the factors below. A <strong>factor</strong> is an explanatory variable that takes on a finite number of values, called levels, set by the researcher.</p>
<p>Study factors (<strong>levels</strong> of each factor are given in parentheses):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tire pressure (low, standard)<br />
</li>
<li>Octane rating of fuel (regular, midgrade, premium)<br />
</li>
<li>Type of driving (defensive, aggressive)</li>
</ul>
<p>They also chose to <strong>control</strong> or hold constant the following variables during the execution of the study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather conditions<br />
</li>
<li>Route<br />
</li>
<li>Tire type<br />
</li>
<li>Past car usage</li>
</ul>
<p>The engineer randomly selected a <strong>sample</strong> of 24 cars from the assembly line for that year and model of car (we’ll learn more about the importance of selecting a representative sample of cars shortly). Software was used to randomly assign a <strong>treatment</strong> to each of the 24 cars. A treatment is a particular combination of the factor levels. For instance, low tire pressure, regular octane fuel, and defensive driving was a treatment. The cars would be called the <strong>experimental units</strong> (EUs) as they are the unit the treatments are assigned to.</p>
<p>The experiment was run and the gas mileage found for each car. As the car was measured, we’d refer to the car as the <strong>observational unit</strong> (OU).</p>
<p>The key thing that makes this study an <strong>experimental study</strong> is the active role the research plays in manipulating the environment. Here, the researcher uses random assignment of treatments to the EUs.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Observational Studies</h3>
<p>Some data comes from an observational study where the researcher collects data without imposing any changes.</p>
<p>For example, an economist wanted to investigate the effects of recently added tariffs on agricultural products to the amount and value of such products that are traded between the United States and Asia. This study had two <strong>response</strong> variables, the amount and value of each product traded between the two parties.</p>
<p>In order to take into account seasonal variation and time of year, the economist decided to compare the two response variables from the current year - 6 months worth of data - against the values of the two response variables during the same 6 month periods for each of the past 5 years. The year variable associated with a measurement was an <strong>explanatory variable</strong>. Alternatively, the year variable could have also been labeled to take on one of two values: no-tariff (past years’ data) or tariff (current year’s data).</p>
<p>The researcher obtained the data from the census bureau and conducted their analysis.</p>
<p>Notice that the researcher, while certainly being actively involved in the careful consideration of the data to be collected and how to format the data, did not actively intervene or impose a change. This is the key component of an <strong>observational study</strong>.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p>Observational Study - researchers collect data without imposing any changes on the study environment.</p>

</div>
<div id="observational-vs-experimental-studies" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Observational vs Experimental Studies</h3>
<p>You may have noticed that both example studies had some things in common. For instance, both studies had <strong>response</strong> variables that characterize the performance of the study in some sense. Importantly, these response variables had variation. That is, observing the variable is non-deterministic even under seemingly identical situations. Accounting for, and dealing with, this variation is at the heart of the reason statistical methods are needed!</p>
<p>There were also <strong>explanatory variables</strong> that the researcher was interested in with regard to their relationship with the response variable. Determining and quantifying these relationships is often the major goal of a study.</p>
<p>Both studies also hoped to make statements or conclusions about a larger group using data from a subset of that larger group. This idea is referred to as <strong>statistical inference</strong>. More formally the group of values, items, measurements, or individuals of interest defines the <strong>population</strong> of interest and the data collected on that group represents the <strong>sample</strong>. The number of observations in the sample is referred to as the <strong>sample size</strong>. For the gas mileage example, the population was all cars of the year and make in question, the sample was the data collected on the 24 cars, and the sample size was 24. For the tariff example, the population was all future agricultural products traded between the United States and Asia, the sample was the information from the six years of trade data, and the sample size is six. The two populations mentioned here differ in that the car population is a <strong>real, finite population</strong> and the trade population is a <strong>conceptual, infinite population</strong>. As long as a finite population is large relative to the sample size, the differences tend not to be important. We’ll discuss these ideas in more detail as they arise.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p>Population - (Possibly conceptual) group of values, items, measurements, or individuals of interest</p>
</div>


<div class="definition">
<p>Sample - Subset of the population on which we observe data</p>
<p>Sample Size - Number of observations in the sample</p>
</div>


<div class="definition">
<p>Statistical Inference - Process of using sample data to make statements or claims about a population. Two major goals of inference:<br />
- Determining and quantifying relationships between explanatory variables and the response<br />
- Predicting the response for some setting of explanatory variables.</p>
</div>

<p>Both of these studies had to determine how to obtain their observations. For the experiment, 24 cars were used. For the observational study, six years of data were collected. How this data is collected can be extremely important in terms of the types of conclusions that can be made. Data should be <strong>representative</strong> of the population in which the researcher hopes to make inference. If not, the conclusions made are likely invalid or in need of qualifications. We’ll discuss the idea of what makes a good or bad <strong>sampling scheme</strong> later in the chapter.</p>
<p>The major difference between the two studies was the active (experimental) and passive (observational) roles played by the researcher. This difference is also of vital importance to the types of conclusions that can be made from the study. A well-designed experiment can often allow the researcher to infer <strong>causation</strong> to the treatments, whereas an observational study cannot imply causation using soley the data.</p>
<p>The conclusions a researcher can make based on how the data were collected and the type of study are outlined in the table below.</p>

<p>Doing an observational study doesn’t mean that your study is bad! An observational study is sometimes done out of necessity when an experiment wouldn’t be ethical or feasible. For the tariff example, there really isn’t a way to conduct an experiment. If we wanted to design an experiment to see if smoking causes lung cancer, that would be unethical because we can’t force people to smoke. The key point is that the implications we can draw will differ greatly between experimental and observational studies and will depend heavily on the quality (in relation to the population) of the data you have. To apply causation to an observational study, <strong>causal inference</strong> methods can sometimes be used. We won’t cover this extensive topic in this text. See the references and readings section for useful readings.</p>

<div id="the-role-of-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> The Role of Statistics</h3>
<p>A <strong>statistic</strong> itself is generally a summary of data. When most people think of statistics they think of things like a batting average or a proportion of people that will vote for a proposal. <strong>Statistics</strong> as a discipline is the science of learning from data. It encompasses the collection of data, the possible design of an experiment, the summarization of collected data, and the modeling or analysis used in order to make a decision or further scientific knowledge.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p>Statistics in everyday use usually refers simply to summaries about data (means/averages, proportions, or counts).</p>
<p>Statistics as a field encompasses a much larger range of ideas including how to collect data, model data, and make decisions or come to conclusions when faced with uncertainty.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Statistical methods are needed in situations where data is variable.</strong> There is no need to apply statistical methods to study the relationship between temperature in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit. Given the degrees in Celsius, we know the exact value in degrees Fahrenheit. However, if we again collected data about the gas mileage of vehicles under the exact same study conditions we’ll get slightly different gas mileage readings. If we observed another six month period of trade data, we’ll see different amounts and values traded. Accounting for this variability in data is the reason to apply statistical methods and is a key component of any statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Ideally, we should try to take a holistic view of a study. Before any data is collected it is vital to understand the goals and background of the study. These will inform the data we’d like to collect as well as the data that we are able to collect - which may need to act as a proxy. A plan should be determined for the actual collection and storing of the data. The entire study design will then inform an appropriate statistical analysis as well as the conclusions that can be drawn.</p>
<p>Taking this bigger picture view of the problem, we can usually follow these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<p>We’ll focus on this entire process in our chapter motivating examples. Mostly, we’ll investigate designed experiments. We attempt to tackle each major topic in this text with a problem-based approach. That is, we identify a real-world (or close to it) motivating example and discuss the relevant statistical ideas in the context of that problem. We then provide a discussion of the main statistical ideas and concepts along with enough mathemathics to fully comprehend the material. Related references and readings are also provided. Each chapter includes with a section that outlines the use of R and SAS for implemention. Finally, where applicable, we include a section dives deeper into the mathematics behind the concepts - this section is always optional!</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Define Objective &amp; Background</h3>
<p><img src="img/defineObjective.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
A nutrition scientist wanted to understand the cleanliness and food hygiene of the vendors at the North Carolina State Farmer’s Market (henceforth the farmer’s market). Secondarily, she wanted to learn about vendor sales to see if there was a relationship with their cleanliness and food hygiene. The researcher had access to the names of each vendor’s business, their general purpose, and the products they sold.</p>
<p>The researcher needed to decide the scope of their study. Formally, they needed to define the <strong>population</strong> of interest. The population is the group of people or units of interest to the researcher. As her interest centered around food-related businesses, she restricted to looking at the vendors which sold horticultural crops. She hoped that conclusions made by her study could apply to all horticulture vendors at the farmer’s market - thus, this is her population.</p>
<p>Note: One could try to do a study at just the North Carolina State Farmer’s Market and extend the results to all farmer’s markets in the state or in the south, but that would require many assumptions to be valid.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.ncagr.gov/markets/chart.htm">list of the horticultural products sold and their availability</a> is reproduced below.</p>
<p><img src="img/availabilitychart-1.jpg" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /><img src="img/availabilitychart-2.jpg" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<div id="select-response" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Select Response</h3>
<p><img src="img/selectResponse.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
The researcher needed to determine the variables to collect that would best help to answer their questions of interest. These variables that characterize the experiment are called <strong>response</strong> or target variables.</p>
<p>To investigate the knowledge of hygiene and safety, a short questionnaire was developed to allow the vendor’s head manager (or similar employee) to describe their safety protocol and knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>For your produce with signs that say “clean” or “washed”, what does this mean?</li>
<li>How are the foods transported to the market? eg: refrigerated/closed storage<br />
</li>
<li>What food safety risks do you as a vendor worry about?<br />
</li>
<li>Do you require one-use gloves to be used? (Yes or No)<br />
</li>
<li>Do you designate a person in charge of money transactions? (Yes or No)</li>
</ul>
<p>The researcher also planned to do an assessment of the cleanliness of each vendor’s station at different times. Her team would pick 30 days during the summer in which they’d walk through the vendor stations and collect the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall is the station clean (Yes or No)<br />
</li>
<li>Is anyone smoking around the food products? (Yes or No)<br />
</li>
<li>Are tables covered? (Yes or No) If so, what is the material?<br />
</li>
<li>Do employees appear to be clean? (Yes or No)<br />
</li>
<li>Are one-use gloves used? (Yes or No)<br />
</li>
<li>Is there a designated person in charge of money transactions (Yes or No)</li>
</ul>
<p>She noted that there is a yearly cycle to the products sold and decided to collect vendors sales information by looking at the (AMT) amount sold in the last year (in dollars), the (PURCHASE) total number of purchases made in the last year, and the (NUM_ITEMS) total number of items sold in the last year. For the last variable, they had to decide how to measure the number of items sold for the different types of crops. For most of the crops looking at the total weight (in lbs) sold made sense. But, for some, other measures were needed. For example, for sweet corn the number of ears sold would be recorded.</p>
<p>You can see that there are many decisions that the researcher must make in simply deciding the response variables to collect! A poor choice here can make or break a study.</p>
</div>
<div id="determine-sources-of-variation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Determine Sources of Variation</h3>
<p><img src="img/determineVariation.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
The response variables clearly have some relationship to other variables that could be collected. For instance, the NUM_ITEMS variable is clearly going to be different based upon what crops the vendor sells. The AMT variable would differ depending on the size of the vendor’s inventory. These are examples of <strong>explanatory variables</strong> or variables that define the study conditions. Explanatory variables go by many names such as predictors, features, or independent variables.</p>
<p><strong>A main consideration about whether or not to record a variable is whether or not the variable would be related to a variation in a response variable.</strong> Since the response variables are truly what is of interest, there is really not much of a point in recording variables that likely have no relationship with it.</p>
<p>Choosing the explanatory variables can also indicate further questions of interest. For instance, the researcher may want to compare the percent of “Yes” for the overall cleanliness score for vendors that mainly sell vegetables to those that mainly sell fruit leading to a comparison across groups being of interest. She may want to try to model the AMT of cantaloupe sold as a function of the cleanliness score.</p>
<p>The average amount for the population or a subpopulation would be referred to as a parameter of interest. Formally, a <strong>parameter</strong> is a summary measure about a population. Common parameters investigated include a mean, proportion, median, or variance of different subgroups of the population.</p>
<p>The explanatory variables she collected about the vendors included the types of crops sold, the services they provide (grow, pack, and/or ship), and whether or not they are a “Got to be NC member”.</p>
<p>For the questionnaire, she added the additional questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any organic or synthetic chemicals/fertilizers/pesticides/manures used on the products?<br />
</li>
<li>Are all foods grown/processed by the vendors?<br />
</li>
<li>What kind of soil were the products grown in? eg: organic/compost/plant material</li>
</ul>
<p>For the assessment of cleanliness, she added the following question:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people are working?</li>
</ul>

<div id="select-design" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Select Design</h3>
<p><img src="img/selectDesign.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
For this study the researchers aren’t interested in doing an intervention so an observational study was being done. The major task to consider for the observational study is how to select participants from the population. The subset of the population we (attempt to) observe our data on is called the <strong>sample</strong>. The <strong>sample size</strong> is the number of measurements in the sample.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would measure every member of our population. This is called a <strong>census</strong>. If a census can be done then the value of a population’s parameter can be found exactly by simply summarizing the population data. However, conducting a census can be extremely costly or time-intensive so most of the time a census cannot be done. This means that the information we collect would likely be different if we collected it again. Accounting for this variability is the main reason statistical analysis is needed.</p>
<p>How the researcher selects their sample is extremely important. This method is often referred to as the <strong>sampling scheme</strong>. Using a statistically valid sampling scheme is vital to the assumptions made when doing statistical inference. A valid sampling scheme implies that every member of the population has a known and non-zero chance of inclusion in the sample.</p>
<p>There are many good ways to select the sample and many bad ways. <strong>Need to get more info about the farmer’s market to finish this part</strong>
(Talk about bad first and why bad - visuals too) Talk about good and why good - visuals too.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Motivating Example: Design - Student Assessment Volunteers</h2>
<p>In this example, we’ll talk through the entire problem process but focus on aspects of experimental design.</p>
<div id="define-objective-background-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Define Objective &amp; Background</h3>
<p><img src="img/defineObjective.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
The Division of Academic and Student Affairs (DASA) is charged with assessing NC State’s general education competency (or Pack Proficiencies) program. This is a set of competencies that every NC State graduate should master by the time they graduate. The five Pack Proficiencies are Critical Thinking, Creative Thinking, Oral Communication, Quantitative Literacy, and Written Communication.</p>
<p>Their competencies go hand-in-hand with the general education program, but should be reinforced throughout each major curriculum.<br />
<img src="img/GEP-and-Gen-Ed-Diagram.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>DASA assesses the quantitative literacy proficiency through a number of instruments including a standardized test that is customized for NC State. Students are assessed when they are freshman and again when they are seniors. However, it is much easier to convince freshman to take this extra (mostly voluntary) exam than it is to convince a graduating senior.</p>
<p><strong>DASA wanted to design an experiment around an email recruitment campaign to determine if there was a type of email that was most effective in recruiting students to sign up to take this low-stakes assessment.</strong></p>
<p>The population of interest was a conceptual population of all future seniors that they would be recruiting via email for their assessment. There were three thoughts about students under consideration:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Certain students might respond to school spirit pleas.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain students might be more motivated by incentives.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain students might be more motivated by sympathy (“We need your help!” requests). For example, anecdotally there were a number of students that took the test in the past because they “felt sorry” for DASA or because DASA was “begging.”</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="select-response-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Select Response</h3>
<p><img src="img/selectResponse.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
The parameters of interest were the true proportions of students that would respond positively to each of three competing email types. The differences in these proportions would give information about the most effective campaign.</p>
<p>Three competing email campaigns were chosen:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A “school spirit” type email where students were encouraged to help make NC State better.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="https://sr.ithaka.org/blog/leveraging-regret-maximizing-survey-participation-at-the-duke-university-libraries/">“regret lottery”</a> style email. Essentially, you will miss your chance at a prize if you don’t take this assessment!</p></li>
<li><p>A “sympathy” style email. “NC State is counting on you, we really need your help for this to work”.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A student would be assigned one of these email types to receive and these emails would be sent out multiple times over a period of time in the spring (last) semester for graduating seniors.</p>
<p>The chosen response was the number of students that responded positively to an email request (this can easily be transformed into a sample proportion and be modeled appropriately).</p>
</div>
<div id="determine-sources-of-variation-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Determine Sources of Variation</h3>
<p><img src="img/determineVariation.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
As the emails would be sent out multiple times, the email period was also recorded in order to investigate any time trends with the three methods.</p>
<p>The following three variables weren’t necessarily of interest but deemed to be possible sources of variation in the proportion that might respond:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because the students in different colleges (Sciences, Textiles, etc.) might respond at different rates, the college the student was enrolled in was identified as an important variable (using the student’s first major).</p></li>
<li><p>Gender was deemed important as there was anecdotal evidence that those that identify as female were more likely to respond to the sympathy campaign.</p></li>
<li><p>To account for some cultural differences, race was also identified as an important variable.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="select-design-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4</span> Select Design</h3>
<p><img src="img/selectDesign.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
The population for this study was the conceptual population of all future graduating seniors. The sample members would be all seniors from the year the study was conducted.</p>
<p>As mentioned, it was decided that a student would be assigned one of these email types to receive and these emails would be sent out multiple times. However, some students were already taking this assessment as part of a senior capstone type course. These students would not be sent the emails. This implied that the group used for the sample wouldn’t exactly represent the population of interest (an example of sampling bias). This smaller group was still used as it made the most practical sense.</p>
<p>The researcher wanted to be able to assign a cause and effect relationship between email type and proportion of respondents. When a well designed experiment is run where the experimenter manipulates the environment this can be done! By <strong>randomizing</strong> the email types to students, the differences observed can reasonably be attributed to the differences imposed. Randomization may not seem necessary but is vital! Suppose we assigned the first third of the students the first email type, the second third the second email type, and the last third the last email type. There may be some underlying characteristic that exists more heavily in the one of the groups. For instance, maybe students with last names near the beginning of the alphabet would be more likely to respond since they’ve often been called on first during their schooling - making them more likely to respond. This is likely not true, but by not randomizing, we risk the systematic effect of underlying variables like this. Using randomization we can at least be assured we have not imposed this problem.</p>
<p>Our goal in the study is really to be able to observe and quantify any <strong>treatment effect</strong>. That is, a difference in the responses due to the email type. If we were to do random assignment of treatments to our entire group, there is a chance of having unbalanced treatment groups simply by chance alone. For example, all students from a small college could be assigned the same email type. This can be dealt with by <strong>blocking</strong> on characteristics and randomly assigning treatments within a blocks. A block is a homogenous group of EUs. We could block based on the combinations of the three explanatory variables noted earlier (college, gender, and race). For instance, one block was black, female, college of sciences students. Within each of these blocks the three email types would be randomly assigned to the students. This is called a randomized complete block design. The word complete here implies that every block received every treatment. By randomizing within blocks we are ensuring that the effects of the blocking variables are as equally allocated across the treatments as possible. (How this process was done using software is included in the software section.)</p>
<p>The last item to mention with respect to the experimental design is the idea of <strong>replication</strong>. The sample size for the experiment was about 5400 yielding about 1800 replications of each treatment. If we see a difference in the behavior of respondents across a large number replications, this gives us more confidence the results of our experiment will extend to the population.</p>
<p>The plan for analyzing the experiment above was to compare the three email campaigns using the overall (across all emails sent) sample proportion that responded positively. (A secondary analysis would be to investigate the trends over time for the email campaigns but this won’t be discussed further.)</p>
<p>A plan for data collected should was made. The data collected would be stored in an excel spreadsheet updated by DASA as the experiment ran.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-study-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5</span> Do Study</h3>
<p><img src="img/conductStudy.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
Once the list of students with their assigned email type was created, DASA began their emailing campaign. Emails were sent at nine different time periods during February. With each time period, the proportion responding positively was recorded. These numbers were pooled into a final talley within each block for analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-statistical-analysis-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.6</span> Do Statistical Analysis</h3>
<p><img src="img/statsAnalysis.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
The data was read into an appropriate software for summarization and analysis. As a first investigation of the data, the sample proportion responding positively for each email type was summarized (without regard to the block used).</p>
<ul>
<li>School spirit email type: 132 of 1861 responded positively (0.071)<br />
</li>
<li>Regret lottery email type: 116 of 1865 responsed positively (0.062)<br />
</li>
<li>Sympathy email type: 114 of 1865 responed positively (0.061)</li>
</ul>
<p>The data were analyzed using methods for a randomized complete block design with a binary response (covered later in the book!). As this is a bit beyond us at this point, we’ll simply consider the raw sample proportions and their differences. The standard error (a measure of how variable the measurement is) in these sample proportions is around 0.006.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.7</span> Draw Conclusions &amp; Communicate</h3>
<p><img src="img/concludeCommunicate.png" width="13%" style="float:left; padding:10px" />
The results of a naive analysis of this study indicated that the school spirit email, on average, had a higher level of participants respond positively to the request. However, this result was not deemed statistically significant. That is, the difference was not large enough to show a difference when taking into account variation in the study.</p>
<p>The end result of this study was to conclude that the email type sent to students didn’t play a very large role in whether or not students volunteered to participate. It is unkown whether or not the senior students in capstone courses would have made a difference in the results of the study. However, since future email campaigns wouldn’t include these students anyway, the final conclusion from the study was to stick with the school spirit type email that was previously used.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="statistical-ideas-and-concepts" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Statistical Ideas and Concepts</h2>
<p>When conducting a study, it is vital to identify the population and questions of interest. As mentioned previously, the <strong>population</strong> is the entire group of units of interest. Once defined, the questions of interest must be determined. Researchers often want to ask things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a difference in the response between group A and group B?<br />
</li>
<li>What should we expect to see if we change variable C?</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these questions are not clearly defined!</p>
<p>What does it mean to have a difference in the response? Are you interested in a difference in the <em>average</em> response for members of the poulation in group A vs those in group B? The <em>median</em> response, the <em>smallest</em> or <em>largest</em> response value, or the <em>shape</em> of the <strong>distribution</strong> of values for members of the poulation in group A vs those in group B? The same detail is required in order to know what to expect with a change. Do you care about the average effect over the entire poulation by changing variable C? Or are you interested in the change in the spread in expected outcomes in the population when the change is made?</p>
<p>Usually, these questions of interest need to be stated in terms of parameters such as the (population) mean, median, or variance. A <strong>parameter</strong> is a measure about the population. These are values that, if we could do a <strong>census</strong> and measure the entire population, we could calculate. However, a census is not usually feasible due to cost constraints or the time that it would take to implement. This implies that answers to the questions of interest that are centered around these parameter values cannot truly be known! Instead, we take a <strong>sample</strong> or subset of the population that we collect our data on. With the sample we calculate (sample) <strong>statistics</strong> or measures about the sample that correspond to or <strong>estimate</strong> the parameter.</p>
<p>As you may expect, a good statistical measure will ‘converge’ in some sense to the parameter as the <strong>sample size</strong>, or number of members in the sample, increases. We’ll discuss how to create an <strong>estimator</strong> (statistic) and properties of good estimators in later chapters. Often the key item that we need to know about an estimator is its (sampling) <strong>distribution</strong>. The distribution of a variable or estimator is simply the pattern in which the quantity is observed. Knowing the distribution allows us to predict the values we should see for that statistic probabilistically (at least under certain assumptions). With an understanding of the predictabilty of an estimator we can then make statements or claims about the population’s parameters with some idea of variability attached! This idea and process of using sample data to discuss population values is the idea of <strong>statistical inference</strong>.</p>
<p>To give clarity to the ideas above, consider a simplified gas mileage example. We want to investigate whether gas mileage differs for low and high tire pressure settings. We could investigate this difference in a number of ways but likely we’d want to know if a ‘typical’ gas mileage would differ between the tire pressure settings. Generally, we think of a typical observation as one near the middle. This could lead to a general question about the difference between the (population) mean gas mileage for all cars driven with high tire pressure against the (population) mean gas mileage for all cars driven with low tire pressure. Alternatively, we might want to know if the gas mileage readings are more variable under one setting or another. This may involve a comparison of population variances or standard deviations (as these are measures of spread - we’ll cover these in chapter 3).</p>
<p>(<strong>Visual of these difference between populations… curves might not be understandable yet though</strong>)</p>
<p>To answer either of the two questions posed above, we need to use the data collected to estimate these population parameters. Quite often, there are intuitive estimators. For instance, to estimate the difference in population mean gas mileages we can simply use the difference in sample mean gas mileages! Similarly, we can compute sample variances and use those to inform us about the differences in the population variances.</p>
<p>(<strong>Visual of estimation idea</strong>)</p>
<p>In order to quantify uncertainty around our sample differences (or sample ratio, etc.), we require knowledge of the distribution (or pattern and frequency of observation) of the sample quantity. This knowledge allows us to calculate probabilities (and eventually create confidence intervals or conduct hypothesis tests).</p>
<p>(<strong>Visual of inference</strong>)</p>
<p>Hopefully, it is somewhat clear that the quality of our sample is vital to the inferences we can make!</p>
<p>Suppose we want to make inference about how well a drug works for treating acne in all people. If our sample consists mainly of people in their 20’s, assumptions and domain-specific knowledge would need to be leveraged in order to extend the results from the study to the entire population of interest. For example, it would need to be argued that people in their 20’s and teenagers, who are likely still going through puberty (among other differences), would have the same reaction to the drug. This issue can be avoided if a sample is <strong>representative</strong> of the population. The next section takes up the issue of obtaining a good sample from the population of interest.</p>
<div id="sampling-schemes" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Sampling Schemes</h3>
<p>The method used to obtain the units for a sample is called the <strong>sampling scheme</strong>. There are good and bad sampling schemes. The main characteristic of a good sampling scheme is the use of a <strong>probability sample</strong>. A probability sample is one where every member of the population has a known and non-zero chance of inclusion in the sample. We’ll study probability in more detail later, but a population member having a non-zero probability of inclusion simply implies, if the sampling scheme was repeated again and again, eventually every unit would be included in at least one of the samples collected. Having inclusion probabilities known for all members of the population allows for the quantification of error associated with sample estimators.</p>
<p>A probability sample requires some <strong>random</strong> mechanism in order to execute the selection of population members into the sample. However, there is a big difference between <em>statistical</em> randomness and the everyday use of the term randomness. <strong>Randomness</strong> in everyday use usually refers to the idea that things are not known beforehand. For instance, if a sample was collected by measuring the next 15 people that passed by us on a busy street, there is randomness but not randomness in a sense that helps statistically. Even though the members aren’t known prior to collecting the sample, the method used to collect systematically excludes people that are otherwise not able to be walking down the street at the time the sample was taken. In statistics, having randomness usually involves a <strong>random number generator</strong> or a software that uses one (methods also include using a random digit table or flipping a coin, but these are mostly obsolete at this point!).</p>
<p>Let’s discuss sampling techniques that utilize a probability sample (and are often executed using a random number generator).</p>
<div id="simple-random-sample" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.1</span> Simple Random Sample</h4>
<p>The most simplistic sampling scheme is the <strong>simple random sample</strong> or <strong>SRS</strong>. The idea is outlined below.</p>
<p>If the population size is <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and the sample size is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign members of the population numbers from 1 to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span><br />
</li>
<li>Use a random number mechanism to select <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> numbers<br />
</li>
<li>The sample is then the population members that correspond to the selected numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>In a SRS, every subset of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from the population has the same chance or probability of being included in the sample. (An SRS also implies that every member of the population has probabilty <span class="math inline">\(n/N\)</span> of being included in the sample. Again, we’ll cover probabiltiy in more depth later.) Since every population member has a known and non-zero chance of inclusion in the sample, this implies an SRS is a probability sample!</p>
<p>An everyday example of a process similar to a SRS is the lottery. Many states have a pick three lottery where the population of balls consist of balls numbering zero, one, two, three, …, nine. The population size is <span class="math inline">\(N=10\)</span>. Three balls are then randomly selected (<span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span>) as the winning combination. Prior to the draw, players select three numbers and can win if they have the same three numbers as those selected. Here any combination of three numbers has the same probability of being selected (<span class="math inline">\(1/\binom{10}{3} = 1/120\)</span>).</p>
<p>Note that an SRS does not guarantee a representative sample every time!</p>
<p>For instance, suppose a university wants to determine the proportion of students that would favor a change to the bookstore. Every student is assigned a campus ID number. Due to time and cost constraints, the university decides to collect data on 400 students. An SRS can be used here to select the 400 students. The sample collected may, by random chance, contain only students from a particular college. The larger the sample, the less likely this is. Obtaining this type of sample doesn’t mean what was done was wrong, it simply means that the sample we obtained may not be very representative of the population. The mathematics and probability used to analyze the sample would still be valid, however, we may be dealing with one of the ‘rare’ samples that give atypical results. An SRS does imply that on average we should get a representative sample. Other techniques can increase the chance of any particular sample being representative of the population (at the expense of being more complicated and sometimes needing to be analyzed in a more complicated manner).</p>

<div id="stratified-random-sample" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.2</span> Stratified Random Sample</h4>
<p>A <strong>stratified random sample</strong> is used when there are important subgroups that the researcher wants to ensure are included in a sample. These subgroups are called <strong>strata</strong>. Once the strata are determined, an SRS is often done within each strata.</p>
<p>For instance, again suppose a university wants to determine the proportion of students that would favor a change to the bookstore. The officials might want to make sure that members of each college are selected into the sample since the use of the bookstore can vary substantially from major-to-major and college-to-college. This time they create five strata, each corresponding to a college at the university. Within each strata they conduct an SRS, selecting 80 people from each college. This gives a total sample size of 400.</p>
<p>(<strong>Visual of stratified RS</strong>)</p>
<p>Note that the proportion of members selected doesn’t need to be constant across the strata. The size of the sample done in each strata might be done proportionally to the total number of students that college constitutes.</p>
<p>For simplicity, assume the total population size was 10000 and the five colleges had student population sizes 3000, 2500, 2000, 1500, and 1000, respectively. The proportion of students in each college can be found as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(3000/10000 = 0.3\)</span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(2500/10000 = 0.25\)</span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(2000/10000 = 0.2\)</span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1500/10000 = 0.15\)</span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1000/10000=0.1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Still looking to obtain a total sample of size 400, we could select</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(0.3*400 = 120\)</span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(0.25*400 = 100\)</span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(0.2*400 = 80\)</span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(0.15*400 = 60\)</span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(0.1*400 = 40\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>students from the each college, respectively.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a larger proportion may be taken from certain strata because they are of greater interest to the researcher.</p>
<p>An advantage of stratified random sampling is that it can be more efficient than an SRS if the units in the strata are more similar than the overall group. This implies that the estimates for quantities will tend to be less variable in the stratified sample.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples-of-bad-sampling-schemes" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.3</span> Examples of Bad Sampling Schemes</h4>
<p>There are many poor choices of sampling schemes that should be avoided. Two examples are a <strong>convenience</strong> (or <strong>haphazard</strong>) <strong>sampling scheme</strong> and a <strong>volunteer response sampling scheme</strong>. These both lead to <strong>sampling bias</strong> where the certain members of the population likely have higher or lower probabilities of inclusion. These probabilities are not usually known so they can’t be taken into account during analysis.</p>
<p>A convenience sample usually implies that the sample consists of the most convenient group available or that the sample members are decided on the spot. For example, again suppose a university wants to determine the proportion of students that would favor a change to the bookstore. If the researcher simply went outside in between class periods and found 400 students that were walking by thier building, this would be a convenience sample. Again, the members of the sample are random in the everyday sense, but not in the statistical sense. Perhaps the researcher was outside on a part of campus that mostly has classes for students in biology and chemistry. The students here are not necessarily representative of the entire college and, certainly, there is no known probability of inclusion associated with every student. Statistical methods quantify uncertainty using probability. Using the probabilities calculated in the analysis would require us to assume the sample was collected in a way that we could account for probabilistically. We’re pretty unlikely to get this right!</p>
<p>A volunteer response sample is one where particpants self-select. The members of a volunteer response sample tend to be those with a strong opinion, both positive and negative, and access to the study. For example, this type of sample is often what is done for end of semester or end of course evaluations. The evaluations are not usually mandatory so, while many in the class will complete the evaluation, those with very strong opinions (both positive and neative) tend to be more likely to respond. In other situations such as online polls hosted by poorly run news sites, only those that are aware and able to access the site can participate.</p>
<p>Neither of these is a probability sample, nor do they implement a random number mechanism! They should be avoided whenever possible. If they are implemented, most statistical analysis methods won’t really be applicable and the best thing that can be done is a simple summary of the data collected (see chapter 3).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-sampling-scheme-matters---a-simulation" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.4</span> Why Sampling Scheme Matters - A Simulation</h4>
<p>The importance of having a probability sample is paramount. To underscore the point, let’s consider what differences and issues we might see using a <strong>simulation study</strong>. A simulation study usually implies that data are generated under certain assumptions using a computer and results are found on the simulated data. Since this process is done on a computer, the process can be repeated many times and the variabilty that is inherent can be accounted for in any comparisons of resutls. Of course, the data generating process must be valid or at least reasonable in order for a simulation study to yield any useful results.</p>
<p>Let’s conduct a simple simulation study to compare the results found when doing an SRS vs those done with a contrived convenience sample.</p>
<p>Suppose our population consists of 100 red and blue marbles. We have interest in investigating the proportion of marbles that are blue. Since we are creating the population we will set this <strong>parameter</strong> value, making it a known quantity! Let’s make the proportion of blue marbles 0.4 (40 blue marbles).</p>
<p>A sample of size 10 will be collected using the two methods outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Method 1: An SRS - marbles are assigned numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 100 at random. This implies the 40 blue marbles are randomly allocated across the numbers. Ten marbles are selected using a random number generator.<br />
</li>
<li>Method 2: A ‘convenience’ sample is done. We’ll use the same labeling of the population as above. However, units 1, 2, …, 50 will have a higher probability of inclusion than units 51, 52, …, 75, and units 76, 77, …, 100 will have zero probability of being included in the sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s produce a sample using each method:</p>

<p>The respective sample proportions of blue marbles found for these two samples are 0.3 for the SRS and 0.4 for the convenience sample. Not much can be learned from a single run of the experiment due to the inherent variability present (new samples would yield new members selected).</p>
<p>Let’s repeat this process! Each time we’ll record the sample proportion of blue marbles for each method. In the end we can compare the <strong>distribution</strong> of the sample proportion using the two methods and assess the differences. To show the process, ten more of these (sample) proportions are reported below.</p>

<p>Remember, the actual value of the population proportion (parameter) is 0.4. It can be hard to see differences between these two methods in only a few samples. With computing power at our fingertips, let’s repeat this process 10,000 times and investigate how the two sampling methods performed with regard to the true proportion of blue marbles, 0.4. The easiest way to visualize the sample proportions’ distributions are by creating histograms. In this case, the histogram will show us how many times we observed each sample proportion possible (0, 0.1, 0.2, …, 1).</p>
<p><img src="StatisticalMethods_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-223-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can see there are differences in the two histograms. The histogram using the convenience sample tended to have slightly larger values for the sample proportion of blue marbles found. If we look at the overall mean of the sample proportions found using the SRS we get 0.402, which is very close to the true value of 0.4 This means that on average the SRS method and the sample proportion are giving the correct parameter. Compare this to the convenience sample method where we get an overall mean of 0.454, which overestimates the population parameter of 0.4. Using the convenience sample to make inference about the true proportion of blue marbles isn’t wise!</p>
<p>This is just a quick example of how using a poor sampling method might affect the analysis done and why we need to use a good sampling method. We ‘created’ a convenience sample here. In real life, the mechanism that underlies the convenience sample wouldn’t be known!</p>
</div>
<div id="practical-sampling-notes" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.5</span> Practical Sampling Notes</h4>
<p>There are many other good sampling schemes such as cluster sampling, sytematic sampling, and heirarchical sampling that can use combinations of techniques. There are also many study designs that attempt to address issues in observational studies such as case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional designs. Some of these will be covered in the book as the come up and references are given at the end of the chapter for those interested.</p>
<p>There are entire books written on proper sampling methods along with the myriad of issues that can come up, especially when dealing with humans. In particular, when doing survey sampling (where a list of questions are given to participants), some issues that come up often (but occur in other places too) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>bias in question writing - leading questions and double barreled questions to name two<br />
</li>
<li>nonresponse bias - sample members don’t answer or respond<br />
</li>
<li>response bias - sample members answer a question wrong on purpose (often due to how they’ll be percieved)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another common issue that arises with sampling is when the list of population units (called the <strong>sampling frame</strong>) doesn’t match the actual population of interest. This is an issue called <strong>undercoverage</strong>. One famous example that relates to this idea comes from the 1936 US presidential election. <em>Literary Digest</em> incorrectly predicted that Landon would overwhelmingly defeat Roosevelt. The prediction was based on survey results from a sample of two million people. The survey had an issue akin to undercoverage. They mailed questionnaires out, but only to people who had both telephones and cars. This left out a large portion of the population and so the results were based on a sample that was not representative of the popoulation. Essentially, their sampling frame didn’t match the population of interest.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider when using historical data is that there can be a bias in data collected. For instance, during world war II the British wanted to know where to place additional armor on their bombers. They had information about the planes that returned from battle and where they had damage. Abraham Wald (known for the Wald test) recommended that it was likely better to put more armor in places that weren’t as badly damaged on the returning aircraft. He reasoned that, if bullet holes were randomly dispersed on the airplane, the bombers that made it back showed where the aircraft could be hit and still function but those that didn’t make it back likely were damaged in other ways.</p>
<p>Sometimes it isn’t feasible to implement a good sampling scheme. For instance, in medical studies volunteers are often used. In a crop experiment, the fields in which crops are planted aren’t usually something you can choose. Clearly, if our population is conceptually infinite, conducting a SRS is not tenable. In these cases, additional out of data assumptions are usually needed when attempting to make inference to entire population. For populations that aren’t human, these assumptions are often more reasonable but shouldn’t be done lightly. For example, suppose the population of interest is all bottles that may be produced by a factory. If a sample of size 1000 is to be chosen, it is likely wise to do a SRS of bottles produces over a series of days rather than the most recent 1000 bottles produced in order to mitigate any systematic issues with the bottle creation process.</p>
<p>Lastly, one thing to note is that the sampling method can play a role in the analysis or modeling technique used but can also sometimes be ignored (assuming a probability sample was done). When the sample size is small compared to the population size (for a SRS, one rule of thumb is <span class="math inline">\(n/N &lt; 0.05\)</span>), we often are able to make an assumption a “random sample” was done rather than a simple random sample. This assumption allows for standard modeling techniques and inference methods to be applied without the issue of dealing with a finite population. We will point out cases in book where the exact type of sampling method and population size plays an important role.</p>
</div>
<div id="observational-vs-experimental-studies-1" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.6</span> Observational vs Experimental Studies</h4>
<p>Sampling schemes are all about obtaining units from your population for your study. Once units are selected there are two basic types of studies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Observational Study</strong> - we observe individuals and measure outcomes without influencing the environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Experimental Study</strong> - we deliberately impose a treatment on units and observe their response.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rememer two important points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We cannot usually infer causation from observational studies, but we can from a well-designed experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiments are not always feasible or ethical. That is, we cannot assign people to smoke a pack a day or have expectant mothers drink a certain amount of alcohol.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For experimental studies, a randomization technique is needed to determine which experimental units obtain which treatments. Sometimes this can go hand in hand with the sampling scheme (perhaps a stratified random sampling and a randomized block design). How to create a sound experiment is important and nuanced (and has added complexity when dealing with humans). Experimental design is the topic of the next section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="fundamentals-of-designed-experiments" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Fundamentals of Designed Experiments</h3>
<p>To describe the methods for creating a well-designed experiment, let’s first recap some definitions from earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response Variable</strong> - variable(s) of interest that characterizes performance or behavior<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Explanatory Variable</strong> - variable(s) of interest with regard to their relationship with the response variable<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Covariate</strong> - quantitative (numerical) explanatory variable (usually observed as the experiment is run and not set by the researcher)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Factor</strong> - explanatory variable that takes on a finite number of values (a Categorical or Qualitative variable)</li>
<li><strong>Level</strong> - setting a factor can take on</li>
<li><strong>Treatment</strong> - specific experimental condition, either the level of a factor (if only 1 factor) or the combinations of the levels from a number of factors
<ul>
<li><strong>Control Treatment</strong> - benchmark treatment sometimes necessary for comparison in human experimentation (to avoid the placebo effect)<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Experimental units (EUs)</strong> - units on which the treatments are assigned<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Observational units (OUs)</strong> - units on which measurements are taken</li>
</ul>
<p>There is clearly a lot of jargon to remember when learning about experimentals and their design. We’ll do our best to remind the reader of these terms as we go along.</p>
<p>Before we dive into experimental designs, we should again discuss the reason we need statistical methods, this time with thorough consideration toward conducting an experiment.</p>
<div id="sources-of-variation" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2.1</span> Sources of Variation</h4>
<p>We’ve discussed that data is variable. If we repeat an experimental study, even with identical conditions, we are likely to obtain different data for the response. This has to do with the sample members being selected differently each time, units being assigned possibly different treatments, or units responding differently to a treatment. Let’s identify the sources of variation in our response.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Treatment effect</strong> - an effect due to the variables assigned by the researcher (treatments) in an experiment. This is an effect we are usually hoping to see and quantify!</p></li>
<li><p>(Other) <strong>Recorded Variables</strong> - some variables that are not of interest are recorded because we may know or think they are associated with variability in the response. These may be covariates (quantitative variables) measured during a study (like temperature) or at the end of a study (tumor size). They can also be variables measured with only a few values (like the soil type a crop is grown in).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unaccounted for Variables</strong> - everything else causing variation. This variation is estimated and used as a reference with which to compare the treatment variation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate, consider a simplified example where a gardener wants to know what water (low or high) and fertilizer (A or B) conditions may be better in terms of producing greater crop yield (dried weight) on average.</p>
<ul>
<li>Response variable is the dried weight of the crop after growth.</li>
<li>Explanatory variables are the two factors:
<ul>
<li>Water (with levels low and high)<br />
</li>
<li>Fertilizer (with levels A or B)<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Treatments are:
<ul>
<li>low water and fertilizer A<br />
</li>
<li>low water and fertilizer B<br />
</li>
<li>high water and fertilizer A<br />
</li>
<li>high water and fertilizer B</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The gardener has two greenhouses each with 16 rows for growing crops. Within each greenhouse they randomly assign the four treatments to the 16 rows. After 45 days, the crops from each row are harvested, dried, and weighed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The experimental units are the rows within the greenhouses<br />
</li>
<li>The observational units are the rows of plants (so we may say the row is also the OU)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sources of variation in the dried weight of the crop are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treatment variation - variation we believe we’ll see in dried weight from the differences in water and fertilizer applications.<br />
</li>
<li>Other recorded variable - greenhouse in which the crops are grown is recorded. Greenhouse is not of interest but may play a role in the variation in dried weight.</li>
<li>Unaccounted for variables - amount of sunlight received, temperature/humidity differentials within a greenhouse, possible differences in the method of application of the treatment (fertilizer and water), and many others may also have an association with dried crop weight. These sources make up a sort of reference variability we can compare our treatment variation to. Ideally this variability is as small as possible!</li>
</ul>
<p>The variation from unaccounted variables can generally be broken down into four cateogries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inherent variability in EUs (units assigned a treatment). No two people, paper towels, concrete blocks, or lab rats are exactly the same so they may respond differently to the same treatment.</p></li>
<li><p>Measurement error - Multiple measurements of a same experimental unit may differ. Two blood pressure readings a few minutes apart may give different readings or if you break a water sample in two and measure each for bacteria, you may see different measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>Variations in applying or creating treatments. Occasionaly a treatment protocol is not clearly defined, leaving room for interpretation. Perhaps applying a fertilizer before or after applying irrigation can cause a difference. If this isn’t clearly specified, two farmer’s may do things differently.</p></li>
<li><p>Other unknown variables sometimes called lurking variables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No matter how hard we try, some of these unaccounted for variables (and hence variation in the response) will remain. What we can do is use good experimental design techniques to try and minimize this variability in order to more clearly see the treatment effects.</p>
</div>
<div id="designing-experiments" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2.2</span> Designing Experiments</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A poorly designed study can never be saved, but a poorly analyzed one has the possibility of being reanalyzed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good experimental designs generally involve randomization, replication, and control. These are discussed in detail below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Randomization</strong> - treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process must use a random number mechanism or software to allocate the treatments. Randomization makes sure that every EU has a chance to get a different treatment. This helps to protect the results of the analysis against a systematic influence of lurking variables.</p>
<p>For example, if a doctor is assigning drug A or B to a patient without use of a random number mechanism, they may unwittingly assign drug A to patients they deem more likely to recover due to implicit biases.</p>
<p>Suppose an experimenter assigns treatment one to the first 50 bottles produced at a factory and treatment two to the next 50 bottles. There may have been an issue with the manufacturing process causing the last 50 bottles to be degraded as compared to the first 50. By not using random assignment, this underlying issue will affect the study’s results.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replication</strong> - multiple (independent) experimental units are assigned the same treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>EUs that receive the same treatment are called <strong>replicates</strong>. By having replication we are able to create an estimate of variability due to our unaccounted for variables. That is, given five replicates, the only differences between them are things not measured or accounted for. Comparing our treatment variation to this variation is what allows us to have faith in the reliability of our conclusions.</p>
<p>Note that replication does not mean that we measure the same EUs multiple times! That is called a repeated measures. Observations from repeated measures experiments cannot usually be considered independent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Controlling Variables</strong> - holding certain variables constant across the EUs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, we’re not interested in the effects of these variables on the response. These variables affect the response in exactly the same manner, so that we don’t see the effects on the conclusions. Unfortunately, we don`t get information on what happens at settings of the variables other than the fixed ones. This decreases generalizability, but reduces overall variation. Experimental designs such as a randomized complete block design attempt to control variables while also maintaining generalizability.</p>
<p>(<strong>Visual of these three concepts</strong>)</p>
<p>Let’s discuss some of the most used experimental designs. We’ll cover analysis for these types of experiments in future chapters.</p>
</div>
<div id="completely-randomized-design-crd" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2.3</span> Completely Randomized Design (CRD)</h4>
<p>A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) is the most straightforward experimental design. Suppose the number of units in the sample is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and the number of treatments is <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The design uses a random number mechanism to randomly assign the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> treatments across the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> experimental units. In a <strong>balanced</strong> design, the same number of units are assigned to each treatment. In this case, the number of replicates is usually denoted by <span class="math inline">\(n_t\)</span>. In an unbalanced design we generically have <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(n_t\)</span> replicates, respecitvely (where <span class="math inline">\(n = \sum_{i=1}^{n}n_i\)</span>).</p>
<p>Suppose we are doing an experiment to determine the effect of nutrition (3 different diets or treatments) on weight gain in humans. If we have 30 experimental units labeled 1, 2, …, 30, a random number generator can be used to reorder the numbers 1 through 30. The first 10 numbers can then be assigned the first diet, the next 20 numbers the second diet, and the last 10 numbers the third diet.</p>
<p>Ideally we want to have as many replicates for each treatment as we can afford. If we had 3 diets and 3 EUs and found that the person assigned the first diet lost more weight than the person assigned to the second diet. This is not a very reliable conclusion! Perhaps the person assigned to the first diet naturally loses weight more easily. However, if we had 100 people assigned to each diet and on average the first diet yieled a greater weight loss, this would be a much more reliable conclusion.</p>
<p>Often to determine the appropriate sample size (or sample sizes for each treatment group) a power analysis or sample size calculation is done. These require assumptions about the population variation in some respect as well as an idea of a “difference of interest.” These topics will be covered later in the book.</p>

<div id="randomized-block-designs" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2.4</span> Randomized Block Designs</h4>
<p>A randomized block design divides EUs with similar characteristics into
‘blocks’ or subgroups. Within each block the treatments are then randomly assigned.</p>
<p>Within a block we are essentially controlling the blocking variable. However, by conducting the design across many settings of the blocking variable, we maintain generalizability of the study.</p>
<p>Let’s consider an example. Two new finishes are developed (type A and type B) for use on a dash board in a car. The material and finish must withstand high temperatures due to the sun and the greenhouse effect. To simulate the temperatures and wear on the dashboard, the dashboards are placed into ovens for 24 hours and the amount of degradation is measured.</p>
<p>The company has 4 large ovens (oven 1, 2, 3, and 4) for testing. The manufacturer finds a random sample of 40 dashboards from the assembly line. Ten dashboards will be placed in each oven. Within the groups of ten assigned to the ovens, five of each treatment were randomly assigned.</p>
<p>The ovens act as the blocks in this experiment. There may be some variation from oven to oven but we don’t really have an interest in this variation. If we’d only used one oven, there may be some odd characteristic of heat flow. By conducting the experiment over several ovens, we can be more confident that our findings would generalize.</p>

<div id="other-experimental-designs" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2.5</span> Other Experimental Designs</h4>
<p>There are many other commonly used designs including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incomplete block designs</li>
<li>Latin squares designs<br />
</li>
<li>Split plot designs<br />
</li>
<li>Randomized complete block split plot designs<br />

<li>2^k designs<br />

<li>3^k designs<br />
</li>
<li>Response surface designs</li>
</ul>
<p>For many of these, we’ll cover the ideas behind the designs as well as their analyses later in the book. Understanding how the treatments are assigned to the EUs is really important when considerting an appropriate method of analysis.</p>

<div id="sampling-schemes-vs-experimental-design" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3</span> Sampling Schemes vs Experimental Design</h3>
<p>When first learning about sampling schemes and experimental design, the randomizations applied can be confusing. The purpose of randomization as applied to experimental design is different from the purpose of randomization in sampling! This confusion is widespread enough to warrant its own brief discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In sampling, randomization is used to determine which members of the population are included in the sample.</p></li>
<li><p>If an experiment is being done, randomization is used to determine which EUs get which treatments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When an experiment is done, if possible, both of these randomizations should occur.</p>
<p>There is also some confusion in the learning process due to the similarities between an SRS and a CRD as well as the similarities between a stratified random sample and a Block design. Again, the key differences are about what the purpose of sampling is versus the purpose of the experimental design. Sampling methods are about getting units for the sample in a sound way. Experimental design is about assigning treatments to units in a sound way.</p>

<div id="software-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Software</h2>
<p>We mentioned the need for random number generation or a random number mechanism for selecting units into the sample as well as assigning treatments to experimental units. This is easily done in software such as R and SAS.</p>
<p>Using software, creating random numbers isn’t something that can be achieved. Instead we have sophisticated algorithms that create sequences of numbers that don’t exhibit patterns. These are called pseudo random numbers and we use these to select units or assign treatments.</p>
<p>These algorithms have to start somewhere. This is called the <code>seed</code> for the algorithm. Quite often software uses something to do with the exact time and date to determine the seed. These makes the seed change depending on when you execute the code. When doing random number generation, it is often preferable to be able to reproduce your results. When this is the case, the user sets the seed for the algorithm.</p>
<div id="r-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1</span> R</h3>
<p>In R, we can set the seed for the random number generation process using <code>set.seed</code>. <code>set.seed</code> takes in an integer as the seed value. Let’s set our seed here using a number off the top of our head in order to get the same results each time this book is created.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb395"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb395-1" title="1"><span class="kw">set.seed</span>(<span class="dv">1310</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<div id="the-sample-function" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1.1</span> The <code>sample</code> Function</h4>
<p>To do a simple random sample in R the <code>sample</code> function works quite well. <code>sample</code> takes in a vector of elements to sample from, the sample size requested, an indicator as to whether or not replacement should be done (so that a unit could be selected more than once), and an optional vector of probabilities of inclusions.</p>
<p>For instance, if we had a population of 1000 units and wanted to do a simple random sample of 15, we could assign each unit in the population a number from 1 to 1000. Next, we could run the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb396"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb396-1" title="1"><span class="kw">sample</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">1000</span>, <span class="dt">size =</span> <span class="dv">15</span>, <span class="dt">replace =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##  [1] 997 693 520 452 478 603 971 640 495 489 794 369 859 879 251</code></pre>
<p>In nonparametric bootstrap sampling (covered later), we want to sample with replacement. This is easily done using <code>replace = TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>If we wanted to do a stratified random sample, we can break the population up into the strata and do a random sample in each. We can sample proportionally or find an equal size sample from each strata using the <code>sample</code> function on each strata.</p>
<p>The <code>sample</code> function can also be used to assign treatments to experimental units. If we assign each EU a number from one to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we can create a vector consisting of all the treatments to be assigned (including replicates) and use this as the input to <code>sample</code>. The appropriate <code>size</code> to select is the same length as the vector, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we had 30 units assigned numbers one to 30 and three treatments (A, B, and C) to assign to ten units each. We could use the following code to assign treatments:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb398"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb398-1" title="1"><span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;A&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;B&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;C&quot;</span>), <span class="dt">each =</span> <span class="dv">10</span>)</a></code></pre></div>

<p>Doing randomization for a block design can be done similarly within each block (<code>sample</code> should be run separately for each block).</p>

<p>Not every block had a count that was divisible by three so random allocation wouldn’t quite be balanced. With such a large sample size this issue was ignored. A seed was set for reproducibility and a function written to do the work of the randomization. The function inputs were the number of treatments (in case another experiment were to be performed with more treatments) and the number of EUs in the particular block. The output was a random allocation of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 (treatments) for a that block.</p>

<p>The process was repeated many times using the <code>replicate</code> function. This function is a wrapper function for <code>sapply</code> (which applies a function to each element of a list and tries to simplify the returned object) and allows for the same code to be run many times. <code>replicate</code> produced a matrix whose columns each represent one sample of ten marbles. The entire matrix was compared to “Blue.” The <code>colMeans</code> function was then applied to this logical object in order to find the sample proportion of blue selected in each sample (logicals are coerced to 0 and 1 for <code>FALSE</code> and <code>TRUE</code>, respectively).</p>

(Graphical parameters, histograms, and adding lines to plots will be discussed in chapter 3!) Next, a histogram was created for each with vertical lines added for the true proportion and the sample proportion. Text was also added to describe the black line.</p>
