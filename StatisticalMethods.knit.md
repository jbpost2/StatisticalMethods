# Sampling, Experiments, and Exploratory Data Analysis 

Placeholder


## Data in the Wild  
### Data from Experiments  
### Data from Observational Studies  
### Experiment Background  
### Selecting Response Variables
### Identifying Sources of Variation 
### Choose an Experimental Design <!-- Is this intended to include any sampling considerations?-->
### Peform the Test  <!-- Wait, does this mean to actually execute the experiment? -->
### Look at the Data  <!-- I think we need to add this as a much needed step!  If nothing else than for data validation.  I'm assuming perform the test now means collect the data. Perhaps this could fall into the Statistically analyze the data part though... Might be good to separate out the exploring/validating part though.  -->
