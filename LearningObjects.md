# Learning Objectives

## Book-level  

After reading this book you will be able to:  
 - illicit relevent sources of variability for a potential study  
 - utilize principles of design to plan a reasonable experiment to help answer questions of interest
 - compare and contrast methods for sampling from a population and designing an experiment when the goal of a study is prediction versus when the goal is statistical inference
 - articulate the scope of inferential conclusions in light of the method of data collection and the experimental design used
 - choose appropriate numerical summaries and graphical displays for a set of data and create these using software
 - explain the general concept of point estimation and how to account for sampling variability
 - explain the importance of statistical distributiosn when conducting statistical inference
 - describe the fundamental inferential techniques of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals
 - compare and contrast the use of and intrepretations from hypothesis tests and confidence intervals
 - fit statistical models in software and interpret their output
