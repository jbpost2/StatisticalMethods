<!-- General Chapter Structure -->
<!-- - Motivating Problem/Problem Idea/What Data to Try to Collect -->
<!-- - Explanation of what a good model might be (or maybe this goes in with the data to try and collect?) -->
<!-- - EDA to explore and further motivate new topic -->
<!-- - Background needed for the model/inference -->
<!-- - Culmination of intro example -->
<!-- - Second example to put it all together -->
<!-- - Resources for when shit hits the fan -->

<!-- Alternative: -->
<!-- - Define the objective of the experiment -->
<!-- - Select appropriate response variables -->
<!-- - Identify sources of variation -->
<!-- - Choose experimental design -->
<!-- - Perform the test -->
<!-- - Statistically analyze the data -->
<!-- - Draw conclusions -->

# Sampling, Experiments, and Exploratory Data Analysis{#sampling}






<!-- - Frame still with question of interest.  Maybe pilot study or study where we mainly care about summary stats.
 - How does data look in the wild and how do we deal with it in the wild.  How could it be modeled via distributions?  Sample representing the larger group.
 - Not too much math here, save that for later mostly.
 - Simulation/Randomization based hypothesis testing.

Thoughts:
Inference ideas - pop, sample, etc.
how we get our units important
  SRS
Good vs bad sampling and the traits
experiment ideas/fundamentals
  CRD
can do experiment or observational
conclusions to make from those (matrix of things)
.
Sample of Random Variable's realizations, sample distribution vs populaton, modeling ideas
Approx probabilities and quantiles vs theoretical
Summaries of distributions (center, spread, graphs)
.
Components of a research study or maybe the general process of a research study
Things to do before and after data collection
Real vs conceptual populations (finite vs infinite)
