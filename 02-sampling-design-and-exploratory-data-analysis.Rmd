## Data in the Wild  

Data is a collection of information about a group, which may include both quantitative and qualitative variables.  Data is ubiquitous in today's society.  Healthcare, marketing, history, biology, ... basically every field has a quantitative aspect.  The quality of data varies greatly from study to study.  


### Data from Experiments  

Some data comes from a well-designed experiment where a researcher uses sound principles to select units and conduct interventions.  

For example, a mechanical engineer wants to determine which variables influence overall gas mileage of a certain year and model of a car.  Gas mileage would be referred to as the **response** variable for this study.  

After careful consideration, the engineer chooses to investigate the following **factors** that may affect the overall gas mileage:  

- Tire pressure (low, standard)  
- Octane rating of fuel (regular, midgrade, premium)  
- Type of driving (defensive, aggressive)

They also choose to **control** or hold constant the following variables during the implementation of the study:  

- Weather conditions  
- Route  
- Tire type  
- Past car usage

The engineer randomly selects 24 cars from the assembly line for that year and model of car (we'll learn more about the importance of selecting a representative sample of cars shortly).  Software is used to randomly assign a **treatment** or combination of the factors for instance, low tire pressure, regulare octane fuel, and defensive driving, to each car of the 24 cars.  The cars would be called the **experimental units** or (EUs) as they are the unit the treatments are assigned to.  

The experiment is run and the gas mileage found for each car.  

This short description exhibits three important concepts in experimental design that we'll come back to many times.

 - Randomization - treatments are randomly assigned to the experimental units   
 - Replication - multiple (independent) experimental units are assigned the same treatment  
 - Control - study conditions are held constant where possible to reduce variability in the response    


### Data from Observational Studies  

Other data comes from observations studies where ...  For example, ... 

<<call out with observational study>>
 
The implications for the conclusions that can be made from a set of data varies greatly with the quality of the data and study design.

<<call out with conclusions table>>
 
Statistics is the science of learning from data.  (Other definition from some book but not sure which - the science of designing studies or experiments, collecting data and modeling/analyzing data for the purpose of decisions making and scientific discovery when the available information is both limited and variable.)

<<call out about statistics, general usage vs this type of definition>>

Statistical methods are needed because data is variable.  For example... The full statistical process begins with ... 
- Define the objective of the experiment  
- Select appropriate response variables   
- Identify sources of variation   
- Choose experimental design  
- Perform the test  
- Statistically analyze the data  
- Draw conclusions  

We'll focus on the entire process of a study and mostly investigate designed experiments.  We attempt to tackle each topioc in this text with a problem-based approach.  That is, we identify a real-world problem and discuss the relevant statistical ideas in context.  Summaries at the end of each chapter recap the main statistical ideas.  

### Experiment Background  

Marketing example.  Goal to describe the customers, how they tend to purchase/shop, and maybe find some shared qualities in order to adverstise curated packages to folks.

Define basic things like population, parameters, statistics, and sample.

Discuss conceptual vs actual populations and when we might care about one or the other.  Our "sample" is really a bit of data from the conceptual population.  Or we could consider it as the population and we just want to describe it. 

### Selecting Response Variables

Marketing example with data such as Clicks, Impressions, Total Revenue, Total Spent, Average Order Value, Sport, Time of visit/purchase, Campaigns running, etc.

### Identifying Sources of Variation 

Consider variables linked to the user.  Age, other accounts, etc.  

### Choose an Experimental Design <!-- Is this intended to include any sampling considerations?-->

Discuss our "sampling" scheme vs a random sample.  This seems like a case where we aren't doing a "good" scheme but not much else could be done...  

Maybe talk about how in the future you could do alternate email ads or something and do an AB type study.


### Peform the Test  <!-- Wait, does this mean to actually execute the experiment? -->

Get the data from google analytics or whatever, have a plan for updating each month?

### Look at the Data  <!-- I think we need to add this as a much needed step!  If nothing else than for data validation.  I'm assuming perform the test now means collect the data. Perhaps this could fall into the Statistically analyze the data part though... Might be good to separate out the exploring/validating part though.  -->

Careful discussion of not selecting a modeling technique based on this unless it is a pilot study or an exploratory study else we have increased our nominal type I error rate... 

(sometimes EDA sometimes data validation only/cleaning - more formal experiments)

Spend a lot of time here talking about graphs of different types.  Sample means, sample variances, etc.

Discuss population curves vs sample histograms and the relationship.

### Statistically Analyze the Data  

New variables as functions of old?

Not a formal test here but comparisons of interest etc.

### Draw conclusions

What actionable things have we found?  Likely some trends to investigate further.  Perhaps run an experiment to formally see if some alteration can be effective.  

What can we conclude realistically from this data?  To what population are we talking?  


## Statistical Testing Ideas  

### Experiment Background 

This example would lend itself to a reasonably easy randomization test or simulation based test.  Maybe an AB type study where we swap labels and do that with a nice visual.

Maybe third example with simulation test.

### Selecting Response Variables


### Identifying Sources of Variation 


### Choose an Experimental Design 

Good discussion of what makes a good sampling design.  Maybe a statified example like the river and selecting houses example as a quick expose of the issues with not doing a truly random sampling technique.

Basics of experimental design (randomization, replication, error control ideas).

Recap benefits of doing an experiment vs an observational study.

### Peform the Test  

### Explore the Data  

NHST paradigm with false discovery?

### Statistically Analyze the Data  


### Draw conclusions

<!-- - Frame still with question of interest.  Maybe pilot study or study where we mainly care about summary stats.
 - How does data look in the wild and how do we deal with it in the wild.  How could it be modeled via distributions?  Sample representing the larger group.
 - Not too much math here, save that for later mostly.
 - Simulation/Randomization based hypothesis testing.

Why learn statistics?
\begin{itemize}
\item	We live in a society that collects volumes upon volumes of data.  
\item Are people looking at the data? 
\item	Are they interpreting the data properly?  
\item How do we turn raw data into information?
\begin{itemize}
\item	to make new policy
\item	to make better product
\item to increase yield
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Statistics is often called the `science of learning from data.'\\~\\

\newpage

\textbf{ex: Gas mileage}\\
Suppose we fill 20 of the same model of car with a full tank of gas.  Each car will have a different miles per gallon.\\
Why?  \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
\textbf{Factors} that affect gas mileage:\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
To summarize the information from the 20 cars we might look at the \textbf{average} gas mileage of the 20 cars.\\~\\
Questions to answer:
\begin{itemize}
\item How do we obtain an overall average miles per gallon for this model of car?  (Not just for these 20.)
\item	overall average when driving in city?
\item overall average when driving on a highway?
\item overall average with low tire pressure?
\item overall average when in a city with low tire pressure?
\end{itemize}
Statistics provides a framework for solving this type of problem!\\~\\~\\


\textbf{Method of statistics often follows a 4 step process}
\begin{itemize}
\item	Step 1: Identify the research objective
\item	Step 2: Collect the information needed to answer the questions
\item Step 3: Organize and summarize the information.
\item Step 4: Draw conclusions from the information.
\end{itemize}
(Repeat as necessary to answer research objective.)

\newpage

\textbf{Big ideas in stats:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - all the values, items, or individuals of interest\\~\\

\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}  - a (usually) unknown summary value about the population\\~\\

\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - a subset of the population we observe data on\\~\\

\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - a summary value calculated from the sample observations
\end{itemize}
~\\~\\~\\~\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{paradigm}
\end{center}
~\\~\\~\\~\\
\textbf{Gas Example:}\\
What is the population, sample, parameter of interest, and statistic (most likely to be used)? 

\newpage

Common Notation in statistics:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
Name & Parameter & Statistic & Quantity Measured\\
\hline
&&&\\
Mean & $\mu$ & $\bar{Y}$ or $\bar{y}$ or $\bar{X}$ or $\bar{x}$ & Center or Location\\
&&&\\
Proportion & $p$ or $\pi$ & $\hat{P}$ or $\hat{p}$ or $\hat{\pi}$ & Location or Frequency\\
&&&\\
Standard Deviation (SD) & $\sigma$ & $S$ or $s$ & Variability or spread\\
&&&\\
Variance (Var) & $\sigma^2$ & $S^2$ or $s^2$ & Variability or spread\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
~\\
Note: $\bar{Y}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i$ and $S^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2$ where $n$ is the sample size (or number of observed values in the sample).\\~\\
Many, many, many, more to come! \\~\\~\\

Question of interest will lead you to which parameter you have interest in.  This will also most likely lead you to which type of data you will collect.\\~\\


\textbf{Scales (Types) of Data:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - A variable that is described by attributes or labels\\
\indent Subscales: \\
Nominal - categories have no ordering (Male, Female) (zip codes)\\
Ordinal - can order categories (Lickert scale data) (college football rankings)\\~\\
\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - A variable that is described by numerical measurements where arithmetic can be performed\\
\indent Subscales: \\
Discrete - finite or countable finite number of values (\# of flowers on a plant, 0, 1, 2, ...)\\
Continuous - any value in an interval is possible (Temperature, $(-459.67\deg F, \infty)$\\
(Some lump these together and call them interval.)
\end{itemize}
~\\
How we summarize and analyze the data will depend on which type of data we have.

\newpage

\textbf{ex: SAT (get to know each other a little!)}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item 50 total students (16 males and 34 females) where matched on socio-economic background (all had similar income). 
\item A study was done to examine the effect of preparation atmosphere on SAT scores.  
\item Two types of atmospheres were investigated (strict vs easy going).
\item Students were divided into two groups of 25 (12 males and 13 females in strict class and 4 males 21 females in the easy going class).
\item After a 9 week tutoring session the SAT was taken (although 1 in the strict group did not take the exam and 5 in the easy going group did not take the exam).
\end{itemize}
With a partner or two (introduce yourselves):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the research question.
\item Define the population and sample.
\item Define possible parameter(s) of interest.
\item Define possible statistics that might be calculated.
\item Why might the students have been matched on socio-economic background?
\item What issues might you see with the design of this study?
\item What other variables might you collect?
\end{enumerate}




\normalsize This class is about analyzing data.  As scientists, most of the time this data will come from a designed experiment, but the methods used for analysis are also useful for observational studies.  However, the conclusions drawn will differ!  Let`s define what me mean by experimental and observational study.\\~\\

\textcolor{red}{Observational Study}
%\underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} 
researchers does not interfere or intervene in the process of collecting data. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Ex: measuring political beliefs in using a poll, measuring yield of a crop based on rainfall\\~\\~\\
\end{itemize}
\underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} researchers manipulate the conditions in which the experiment is done. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Ex: assigning different fertilizers and irrigation method and measuring crop yield, assigning temperatures of water to tanks containing a fish and observing weight gain
\end{itemize}
~\\
Big difference in conclusions drawn!
\begin{itemize}
\item Cannot usually infer causation from observational experiments, but you can from a well-designed experiment.
\item Experiments are not always feasible or ethical.  i.e. cannot assign people to smoke a pack a day or have expectant mothers drink a certain amount of alcohol.
\end{itemize}
~\\~\\
To describe the methods for creating a well-designed experiment, we first need some definitions.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Response Variable} - Variable of interest that characterizes performance or behavior.
\item \textbf{Explanatory Variables} - Variables that determine the study conditions (can be quantitative or categorical).
\item \textbf{Factor} - Explanatory variable of interest.
\item \textbf{Level} -	The specified value of a factor (or explanatory variable).
\item \textbf{Confounding Variable} - Explanatory variable (not of interest) that may mask (or enhance) the effect of a factor.
\item \textbf{Covariate} - Quantitative confounding variable.
\item \textbf{Treatment} - A specific experimental condition, either the level of a factor (if only 1 factor) or the combinations of levels from a number of factors.
\item \textbf{Experimental units (EUs)} - Units on which the treatments are assigned.
\item \textbf{Measurement (Observational) units} - Units on which values are observed (often the same as EUs, but not always).
\item \textbf{Replicate} - Name given to EUs that receive the same treatment.
\item \textbf{Control Treatment} - Benchmark treatment sometimes necessary for comparison (to avoid the \textit{placebo effect}).
\item \textbf{Experimental Error} - Used to describe the variation in response among EUs that are assigned the same treatment.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example: } An experiment was run to determine the effects of adding phosphorous ($0, 147, 294, 441$ $kg/m^2$) and nitrogen ($0, 45, 90, 135$ $kg/m^2$) to the soil of a certain type of grass (a Miscanthus species).  The growth of the plant was of interest and at the end of the growing period the plant was dried and the weight recorded with the final measurement being recorded in megagram per hectare ($0.1$ $kg/m^2$).  Four plots of grass were used in total.  Within each plot, each combination of phosphorous and nitrogen was observed.  The plots were arranged in a large field in a 4x1 rectangle (north to south).  There is a possibility of a water gradient as a stream runs to the north of the field.   A partial data table is given here: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
\hline
Plot	&P	&N&	Dry yield\\
\hline
1&	0&	135&	1.95\\
1&	0&	45&	3.51\\
1&	0&	90&	2.87\\
1&	0&	0&	2.88\\
1&	294	&45&	2.37\\
1&	294	&0&	3.5\\
1&	294	&135&	3.55\\
1&	294&	90&	4.4\\
...&...&...&...\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Let`s identify (if possible) the response, explanatory variable(s), factor(s), level(s), confounding variable(s), treatment(s), number of replicates, experimental units, and observational units.  \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
(See example 2.4/2.7 and the resulting discussion for more practice)

\newpage

Notice that many of the response values are different.  What is causing them to be different?\\~\\
Sources of Variation in the responses of an experiment:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Treatment effect} - we hope there is an effect due to the variables we are setting
\item \textbf{Identified confounding variables} - We record some variables that are not of interest, but we think may have an effect on the response.
\item \textbf{Unidentified sources (these make up the Experimental Error or error variation)} -
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Inherent variability in experimental units - Experimental units are different! \\
		Ex: No two people, paper towels, concrete blocks, or even lab rats are exactly the same.\\
		Consequence: Experimental units respond differently to the same treatment
			\item Measurement error - Multiple measurements of a same experimental unit typically contain error.\\
			If the same experimental unit is measured more than once, will the value be the same?\\
			Ex: Blood Pressure, Break a water sample in two, measure each for bacteria
			\item Variations in applying/creating treatments\\
		The treatment is not clearly defined, leaving room for interpretation.  \\
			Ex:  Two researchers mix concrete, one stirs for 10 minutes and one for 20 minutes, will they come out exactly the same? Temperature is of interest but two ovens don`t heat exactly the same, etc.
			\item Effects from any other extraneous (or lurking) variables - Extraneous variables are those variables that are not part of the treatment, but may influence the response.\\
			Ex: For the oven example, the experiment is done over the course of several days.  There may be slight differences due to humidity changes.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Let`s identify these in the grass growth example.
\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
(See example 2.5/2.6 and the resulting discussion for more practice)

\newpage

No matter how hard we try, some experimental error will remain. What we can do is use good experimental design techniques to ensure our study is valid.\\~\\
DOE is about creating the optimal experiment to determine the effects of different treatments.  Different types of experimental designs are then analyzed differently.\\~\\
\textbf{Pillars of Experimental Design}\\
\begin{enumerate}
		\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - means that the treatments are randomly allocated to the EUs.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Every EU has a chance to get a different treatment, so helps protect the results of the analysis against a systematic influence of lurking variables.  
				\item Allows the observed responses to be regarded as a random sample.
			\end{enumerate}
		Note: Different randomization schemes lead to different statistical analyses.\\~\\
		\underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - for t treatments, replicated $n_t$ times each, use a random number generator to assign the treatments to the EUs.\\~\\
		Most basic randomization design - assumes all EUs are exchangeable.\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
		\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - Repetition of an experiment using a large group of subjects to reduce chance variation in the results
\begin{enumerate}
				\item Allows us to generalize the results to the population and increases reliability of conclusions. 
				\item Allows an estimate of variability (an estimate of experimental error) not due to the treatment effect.
			\end{enumerate}
Note: Replication does not mean that we measure the same EUs multiple times, this is called repeated measures.  Observations from repeated measures experiments cannot 	usually be considered independent.
%\noindent\textit{Ideally as many EUs as we can afford.  Think if we had 3 diets and 3 EUs.  Diet 1 was better than diet 2 and diet 3, not a very reliable conclusion, perhaps person 1 just loses weight more easily.  Now if 100 people at each diet and on average diet 1 was much better, more reliable conclusion.}\\~\\
%\noindent\textit{By averaging over the many observations we can reduce the effects of measurement error and error in applying/creating the treatments.}\\~\\
\newpage
		\item \textbf{Methods for accounting for/reducing experimental error}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Controlling Variables - holding certain variables constant across the EUs\\
			Decreases generalizability, but reduces experimental error.\\~\\
\noindent\textit{We`re not interested in the effects of these variables on the response.  These variables affect the response in exactly the same manner, so that we	don`t see the effects on the conclusions. We don`t get information on what happens at levels other than the fixed one.}
		\item Blocking - Divide subjects with similar characteristics into `blocks', and then within each block, randomly assign subjects to treatment groups.\\~\\
			Blocks - Groups of EUs sharing a common level of a confounding variable.\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{block.jpg}
\end{center}
			Similar to controlling, but allows for increased generalizability.  EUs within a block are very similar (decreases experimental error there as all the EUs in a block are affected similarly by the confounding variable).  By having enough blocks to cover the range of the population you can still generalize.)
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
		\noindent\textit{There are also methods for dealing with some explained experimental error during the analysis stage - Namely ANCOVA.\\~\\
		These ideas are very important.  Unless you are well versed in statistical methods and ideas you should consult a statistician before investing time and money in an experiment.\\
`A poorly designed study can never be saved, but a poorly analyzed one has the possibility of being reanalyzed.'}







\normalsize \\~\\
Recall:  Process of a study involves
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the research objective
\item Collect the information needed to answer the questions
\item Organize and summarize the information.
\item Draw conclusions from the information.
\end{enumerate}
We will now talk about step 3!\\~\\
So you have data... now what??\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{spreadsheet}
\end{center}

Whether we are describing an observed population or using sampled data to draw an inference from the sample to the population, an insightful description of the data is an important step in drawing conclusions from it.  \\~\\

Good descriptive statistics enable us to make sense of the data by reducing a large set of measurements to a few summary measures that provide a good, rough picture of the original measurements.\\~\\

Summary measure used for a variable depends on its \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}.\\~\\

Our goal will be to describe the variable's \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}\\~\\
i.e. the \\~\\

Two major characteristics of the variable's distribution that we often describe are \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}\\~\\ and \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}\\~\\

We will mostly deal with quantitative variables and our focus will be on their summary measures.  However, we will briefly talk about graphs and statistics for categorical variables.\\~\\

\huge Categorical Variables \normalsize\\
Numerical measure used for categorical variable:\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
For this simple study, we can find the sample proportion for each categorical variable:\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{paintexample}

\newpage

The main plots used are \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} and  \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}.\\~\\
 
\underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}  - use percents to display data. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Order does not matter (although should order from highest percentage to lowest)
\end{itemize}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{piechart}\\
\underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}  - Categories along the x-axis.  Count, percent, or relative frequency (sample proportion) along the y-axis.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Order does not matter (although should order from highest percentage to lowest).  
\item A gap should exist between the bars.
\end{itemize}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{bargraph}

\newpage

We might also have multiple categorical variables of interest.  In which case, a good display of the data is\\~\\
a \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}.\\~\\
Let's create one for the paint example from earlier.\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\

Book example on page 103 is nice.  \\~\\

Many other methods exist such as comparative bar charts:\\~\\

\huge Quantitative Variables \normalsize\\
We will again consider the paint example:\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{paintexample}\\
Numerical measures of location:\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
\newpage
Numerical Measures of Spread
\newpage
The main plots used are \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} and  \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}.\\~\\

A \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} is obtained by splitting the range of the data into equal-sized bins. Then for each bin, we count the number of points that fall into each bin and that is the height of our bar (or use relative frequency - i.e. proportion in category).  
\begin{itemize}
\item Typically, an observation equal to a boundary value is put in the higher interval.
\item Bars should touch!
\item Too many classes will spread the data out, thereby not revealing the pattern.  Too few classes will lump the data.  
\item **** This is the most important graphical technique for displaying the distribution of a quantitative variable!
\end{itemize}
Ex. Ages of the winners of the best actress Academy Award in the recent 20 years (1994-2013) are: 36, 45, 49, 39, 34, 26, 25, 33, 35, 35, 28, 30, 29, 61, 32, 33, 45,29, 62 and 22\\

\item Measure of center from a boxplot - \\

If we have two quantitative variables of interest, we often look at \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} \\~\\
and \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} to inspect the `linear association' between the variables (call them x and y).\\
