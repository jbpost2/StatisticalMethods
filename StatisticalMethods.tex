\chapter{Sampling, Experiments, and Exploratory Data
Analysis}\label{sampling-experiments-and-exploratory-data-analysis}

\section{Data in the Wild}\label{data-in-the-wild}

Data is a collection of information about a group, which may include
both quantitative and qualitative variables. Data is ubiquitous in
today's society. Healthcare, marketing, history, biology, \ldots{}
basically every field has a quantitative aspect. The quality of data
varies greatly from study to study.

\subsection{Data from Experiments}\label{data-from-experiments}

Some data comes from a well-designed experiment where a researcher uses
sound principles to select units and conduct interventions.

For example, a mechanical engineer wants to determine which variables
influence overall gas mileage of a certain year and model of a car. Gas
mileage would be referred to as the \textbf{response} variable for this
study.

After careful consideration, the engineer chooses to investigate the
following \textbf{factors} that may affect the overall gas mileage:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tire pressure (low, standard)\\
\item
  Octane rating of fuel (regular, midgrade, premium)\\
\item
  Type of driving (defensive, aggressive)
\end{itemize}

They also choose to \textbf{control} or hold constant the following
variables during the implementation of the study:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Weather conditions\\
\item
  Route\\
\item
  Tire type\\
\item
  Past car usage
\end{itemize}

The engineer randomly selects 24 cars from the assembly line for that
year and model of car (we'll learn more about the importance of
selecting a representative sample of cars shortly). Software is used to
randomly assign a \textbf{treatment} or combination of the factors for
instance, low tire pressure, regulare octane fuel, and defensive
driving, to each car of the 24 cars. The cars would be called the
\textbf{experimental units} or (EUs) as they are the unit the treatments
are assigned to.

The experiment is run and the gas mileage found for each car.

This short description exhibits three important concepts in experimental
design that we'll come back to many times.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Randomization - treatments are randomly assigned to the experimental
  units\\
\item
  Replication - multiple (independent) experimental units are assigned
  the same treatment\\
\item
  Control - study conditions are held constant where possible to reduce
  variability in the response
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data from Observational
Studies}\label{data-from-observational-studies}

Other data comes from observations studies where \ldots{} For example,
\ldots{}

\textless{}\textgreater{}

The implications for the conclusions that can be made from a set of data
varies greatly with the quality of the data and study design.

\textless{}\textgreater{}

Statistics is the science of learning from data. (Other definition from
some book but not sure which - the science of designing studies or
experiments, collecting data and modeling/analyzing data for the purpose
of decisions making and scientific discovery when the available
information is both limited and variable.)

\textless{}\textgreater{}

Statistical methods are needed because data is variable. For
example\ldots{} The full statistical process begins with \ldots{} -
Define the objective of the experiment\\
- Select appropriate response variables\\
- Identify sources of variation\\
- Choose experimental design\\
- Perform the test\\
- Statistically analyze the data\\
- Draw conclusions

We'll focus on the entire process of a study and mostly investigate
designed experiments. We attempt to tackle each topioc in this text with
a problem-based approach. That is, we identify a real-world problem and
discuss the relevant statistical ideas in context. Summaries at the end
of each chapter recap the main statistical ideas.

\subsection{Experiment Background}\label{experiment-background}

Marketing example. Goal to describe the customers, how they tend to
purchase/shop, and maybe find some shared qualities in order to
adverstise curated packages to folks.

Define basic things like population, parameters, statistics, and sample.

Discuss conceptual vs actual populations and when we might care about
one or the other. Our ``sample'' is really a bit of data from the
conceptual population. Or we could consider it as the population and we
just want to describe it.

\subsection{Selecting Response
Variables}\label{selecting-response-variables}

Marketing example with data such as Clicks, Impressions, Total Revenue,
Total Spent, Average Order Value, Sport, Time of visit/purchase,
Campaigns running, etc.

\subsection{Identifying Sources of
Variation}\label{identifying-sources-of-variation}

Consider variables linked to the user. Age, other accounts, etc.

\subsection{Choose an Experimental Design
}\label{choose-an-experimental-design}

Discuss our ``sampling'' scheme vs a random sample. This seems like a
case where we aren't doing a ``good'' scheme but not much else could be
done\ldots{}

Maybe talk about how in the future you could do alternate email ads or
something and do an AB type study.

\subsection{Peform the Test }\label{peform-the-test}

Get the data from google analytics or whatever, have a plan for updating
each month?

\subsection{Look at the Data }\label{look-at-the-data}

Careful discussion of not selecting a modeling technique based on this
unless it is a pilot study or an exploratory study else we have
increased our nominal type I error rate\ldots{}

(sometimes EDA sometimes data validation only/cleaning - more formal
experiments)

Spend a lot of time here talking about graphs of different types. Sample
means, sample variances, etc.

Discuss population curves vs sample histograms and the relationship.

\subsection{Statistically Analyze the
Data}\label{statistically-analyze-the-data}

New variables as functions of old?

Not a formal test here but comparisons of interest etc.

\subsection{Draw conclusions}\label{draw-conclusions}

What actionable things have we found? Likely some trends to investigate
further. Perhaps run an experiment to formally see if some alteration
can be effective.

What can we conclude realistically from this data? To what population
are we talking?

\section{Statistical Testing Ideas}\label{statistical-testing-ideas}

\subsection{Experiment Background}\label{experiment-background-1}

This example would lend itself to a reasonably easy randomization test
or simulation based test. Maybe an AB type study where we swap labels
and do that with a nice visual.

Maybe third example with simulation test.

\subsection{Selecting Response
Variables}\label{selecting-response-variables-1}

\subsection{Identifying Sources of
Variation}\label{identifying-sources-of-variation-1}

\subsection{Choose an Experimental
Design}\label{choose-an-experimental-design-1}

Good discussion of what makes a good sampling design. Maybe a statified
example like the river and selecting houses example as a quick expose of
the issues with not doing a truly random sampling technique.

Basics of experimental design (randomization, replication, error control
ideas).

Recap benefits of doing an experiment vs an observational study.

\subsection{Peform the Test}\label{peform-the-test-1}

\subsection{Explore the Data}\label{explore-the-data}

NHST paradigm with false discovery?

\subsection{Statistically Analyze the
Data}\label{statistically-analyze-the-data-1}

\subsection{Draw conclusions}\label{draw-conclusions-1}

Why learn statistics?

\begin{itemize}
\item   We live in a society that collects volumes upon volumes of data.  
\item Are people looking at the data? 
\item   Are they interpreting the data properly?  
\item How do we turn raw data into information?
\begin{itemize}
\item   to make new policy
\item   to make better product
\item to increase yield
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Statistics is often called the `science of learning from
data.'\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}

\newpage

\textbf{ex: Gas mileage}\textbackslash{} Suppose we fill 20 of the same
model of car with a full tank of gas. Each car will have a different
miles per gallon.\textbackslash{} Why?
\textbackslash{}\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}
\textbf{Factors} that affect gas
mileage:\textbackslash{}\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}
To summarize the information from the 20 cars we might look at the
\textbf{average} gas mileage of the 20
cars.\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{} Questions to
answer:

\begin{itemize}
\item How do we obtain an overall average miles per gallon for this model of car?  (Not just for these 20.)
\item   overall average when driving in city?
\item overall average when driving on a highway?
\item overall average with low tire pressure?
\item overall average when in a city with low tire pressure?
\end{itemize}

Statistics provides a framework for solving this type of
problem!\textbackslash{}\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}

\textbf{Method of statistics often follows a 4 step process}

\begin{itemize}
\item   Step 1: Identify the research objective
\item   Step 2: Collect the information needed to answer the questions
\item Step 3: Organize and summarize the information.
\item Step 4: Draw conclusions from the information.
\end{itemize}

(Repeat as necessary to answer research objective.)

\newpage

\textbf{Big ideas in stats:}\textbackslash{}

\begin{itemize}
\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - all the values, items, or individuals of interest\\~\\

\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}  - a (usually) unknown summary value about the population\\~\\

\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - a subset of the population we observe data on\\~\\

\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - a summary value calculated from the sample observations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Gas Example:}\textbackslash{} What is the population, sample,
parameter of interest, and statistic (most likely to be used)?

\newpage

Common Notation in statistics:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
Name & Parameter & Statistic & Quantity Measured\\
\hline
&&&\\
Mean & $\mu$ & $\bar{Y}$ or $\bar{y}$ or $\bar{X}$ or $\bar{x}$ & Center or Location\\
&&&\\
Proportion & $p$ or $\pi$ & $\hat{P}$ or $\hat{p}$ or $\hat{\pi}$ & Location or Frequency\\
&&&\\
Standard Deviation (SD) & $\sigma$ & $S$ or $s$ & Variability or spread\\
&&&\\
Variance (Var) & $\sigma^2$ & $S^2$ or $s^2$ & Variability or spread\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{} Note:
\(\bar{Y}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i\) and
\(S^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2\) where \(n\) is the
sample size (or number of observed values in the
sample).\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{} Many, many,
many, more to come!
\textbackslash{}\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}

Question of interest will lead you to which parameter you have interest
in. This will also most likely lead you to which type of data you will
collect.\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}

\textbf{Scales (Types) of Data:}\textbackslash{}

\begin{itemize}
\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - A variable that is described by attributes or labels\\
\indent Subscales: \\
Nominal - categories have no ordering (Male, Female) (zip codes)\\
Ordinal - can order categories (Lickert scale data) (college football rankings)\\~\\
\item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - A variable that is described by numerical measurements where arithmetic can be performed\\
\indent Subscales: \\
Discrete - finite or countable finite number of values (\# of flowers on a plant, 0, 1, 2, ...)\\
Continuous - any value in an interval is possible (Temperature, $(-459.67\deg F, \infty)$\\
(Some lump these together and call them interval.)
\end{itemize}

\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{} How we summarize and analyze the data
will depend on which type of data we have.

\newpage

\textbf{ex: SAT (get to know each other a little!)}\textbackslash{}

\begin{itemize}
\item 50 total students (16 males and 34 females) where matched on socio-economic background (all had similar income). 
\item A study was done to examine the effect of preparation atmosphere on SAT scores.  
\item Two types of atmospheres were investigated (strict vs easy going).
\item Students were divided into two groups of 25 (12 males and 13 females in strict class and 4 males 21 females in the easy going class).
\item After a 9 week tutoring session the SAT was taken (although 1 in the strict group did not take the exam and 5 in the easy going group did not take the exam).
\end{itemize}

With a partner or two (introduce yourselves):

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the research question.
\item Define the population and sample.
\item Define possible parameter(s) of interest.
\item Define possible statistics that might be calculated.
\item Why might the students have been matched on socio-economic background?
\item What issues might you see with the design of this study?
\item What other variables might you collect?
\end{enumerate}

\normalsize This class is about analyzing data. As scientists, most of
the time this data will come from a designed experiment, but the methods
used for analysis are also useful for observational studies. However,
the conclusions drawn will differ! Let`s define what me mean by
experimental and observational
study.\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}

\textcolor{red}{Observational Study}
\%\underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} researchers does not
interfere or intervene in the process of collecting data.

\begin{itemize}
\item Ex: measuring political beliefs in using a poll, measuring yield of a crop based on rainfall\\~\\~\\
\end{itemize}

\underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} researchers manipulate
the conditions in which the experiment is done.

\begin{itemize}
\item Ex: assigning different fertilizers and irrigation method and measuring crop yield, assigning temperatures of water to tanks containing a fish and observing weight gain
\end{itemize}

\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{} Big difference in conclusions drawn!

\begin{itemize}
\item Cannot usually infer causation from observational experiments, but you can from a well-designed experiment.
\item Experiments are not always feasible or ethical.  i.e. cannot assign people to smoke a pack a day or have expectant mothers drink a certain amount of alcohol.
\end{itemize}

\textsubscript{\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{} To describe the methods
for creating a well-designed experiment, we first need some definitions.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Response Variable} - Variable of interest that characterizes performance or behavior.
\item \textbf{Explanatory Variables} - Variables that determine the study conditions (can be quantitative or categorical).
\item \textbf{Factor} - Explanatory variable of interest.
\item \textbf{Level} -  The specified value of a factor (or explanatory variable).
\item \textbf{Confounding Variable} - Explanatory variable (not of interest) that may mask (or enhance) the effect of a factor.
\item \textbf{Covariate} - Quantitative confounding variable.
\item \textbf{Treatment} - A specific experimental condition, either the level of a factor (if only 1 factor) or the combinations of levels from a number of factors.
\item \textbf{Experimental units (EUs)} - Units on which the treatments are assigned.
\item \textbf{Measurement (Observational) units} - Units on which values are observed (often the same as EUs, but not always).
\item \textbf{Replicate} - Name given to EUs that receive the same treatment.
\item \textbf{Control Treatment} - Benchmark treatment sometimes necessary for comparison (to avoid the \textit{placebo effect}).
\item \textbf{Experimental Error} - Used to describe the variation in response among EUs that are assigned the same treatment.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example: } An experiment was run to determine the effects of
adding phosphorous (\(0, 147, 294, 441\) \(kg/m^2\)) and nitrogen
(\(0, 45, 90, 135\) \(kg/m^2\)) to the soil of a certain type of grass
(a Miscanthus species). The growth of the plant was of interest and at
the end of the growing period the plant was dried and the weight
recorded with the final measurement being recorded in megagram per
hectare (\(0.1\) \(kg/m^2\)). Four plots of grass were used in total.
Within each plot, each combination of phosphorous and nitrogen was
observed. The plots were arranged in a large field in a 4x1 rectangle
(north to south). There is a possibility of a water gradient as a stream
runs to the north of the field. A partial data table is given here:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
\hline
Plot    &P  &N& Dry yield\\
\hline
1&  0&  135&    1.95\\
1&  0&  45& 3.51\\
1&  0&  90& 2.87\\
1&  0&  0&  2.88\\
1&  294 &45&    2.37\\
1&  294 &0& 3.5\\
1&  294 &135&   3.55\\
1&  294&    90& 4.4\\
...&...&...&...\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Let`s identify (if possible) the response, explanatory variable(s),
factor(s), level(s), confounding variable(s), treatment(s), number of
replicates, experimental units, and observational units.

\newpage

Notice that many of the response values are different. What is causing
them to be different?\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}
Sources of Variation in the responses of an experiment:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Treatment effect} - we hope there is an effect due to the variables we are setting
\item \textbf{Identified confounding variables} - We record some variables that are not of interest, but we think may have an effect on the response.
\item \textbf{Unidentified sources (these make up the Experimental Error or error variation)} -
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Inherent variability in experimental units - Experimental units are different! \\
        Ex: No two people, paper towels, concrete blocks, or even lab rats are exactly the same.\\
        Consequence: Experimental units respond differently to the same treatment
            \item Measurement error - Multiple measurements of a same experimental unit typically contain error.\\
            If the same experimental unit is measured more than once, will the value be the same?\\
            Ex: Blood Pressure, Break a water sample in two, measure each for bacteria
            \item Variations in applying/creating treatments\\
        The treatment is not clearly defined, leaving room for interpretation.  \\
            Ex:  Two researchers mix concrete, one stirs for 10 minutes and one for 20 minutes, will they come out exactly the same? Temperature is of interest but two ovens don`t heat exactly the same, etc.
            \item Effects from any other extraneous (or lurking) variables - Extraneous variables are those variables that are not part of the treatment, but may influence the response.\\
            Ex: For the oven example, the experiment is done over the course of several days.  There may be slight differences due to humidity changes.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Let`s identify these in the grass growth example.

No matter how hard we try, some experimental error will remain. What we
can do is use good experimental design techniques to ensure our study is
valid.\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{} DOE is about
creating the optimal experiment to determine the effects of different
treatments. Different types of experimental designs are then analyzed
differently.\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}
\textbf{Pillars of Experimental Design}\textbackslash{}

\begin{enumerate}
        \item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - means that the treatments are randomly allocated to the EUs.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Every EU has a chance to get a different treatment, so helps protect the results of the analysis against a systematic influence of lurking variables.  
                \item Allows the observed responses to be regarded as a random sample.
            \end{enumerate}
        Note: Different randomization schemes lead to different statistical analyses.\\~\\
        \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - for t treatments, replicated $n_t$ times each, use a random number generator to assign the treatments to the EUs.\\~\\
        Most basic randomization design - assumes all EUs are exchangeable.\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
        \item \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} - Repetition of an experiment using a large group of subjects to reduce chance variation in the results
\begin{enumerate}
                \item Allows us to generalize the results to the population and increases reliability of conclusions. 
                \item Allows an estimate of variability (an estimate of experimental error) not due to the treatment effect.
            \end{enumerate}
Note: Replication does not mean that we measure the same EUs multiple times, this is called repeated measures.  Observations from repeated measures experiments cannot  usually be considered independent.
%\noindent\textit{Ideally as many EUs as we can afford.  Think if we had 3 diets and 3 EUs.  Diet 1 was better than diet 2 and diet 3, not a very reliable conclusion, perhaps person 1 just loses weight more easily.  Now if 100 people at each diet and on average diet 1 was much better, more reliable conclusion.}\\~\\
%\noindent\textit{By averaging over the many observations we can reduce the effects of measurement error and error in applying/creating the treatments.}\\~\\
\newpage
        \item \textbf{Methods for accounting for/reducing experimental error}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Controlling Variables - holding certain variables constant across the EUs\\
            Decreases generalizability, but reduces experimental error.\\~\\
\noindent\textit{We`re not interested in the effects of these variables on the response.  These variables affect the response in exactly the same manner, so that we    don`t see the effects on the conclusions. We don`t get information on what happens at levels other than the fixed one.}
        \item Blocking - Divide subjects with similar characteristics into `blocks', and then within each block, randomly assign subjects to treatment groups.\\~\\
            Blocks - Groups of EUs sharing a common level of a confounding variable.\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{block.jpg}
\end{center}
            Similar to controlling, but allows for increased generalizability.  EUs within a block are very similar (decreases experimental error there as all the EUs in a block are affected similarly by the confounding variable).  By having enough blocks to cover the range of the population you can still generalize.)
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

\noindent\textit{There are also methods for dealing with some explained experimental error during the analysis stage - Namely ANCOVA.\\~\\
        These ideas are very important.  Unless you are well versed in statistical methods and ideas you should consult a statistician before investing time and money in an experiment.\\

Process of a study involves

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the research objective

Whether we are describing an observed population or using sampled data
to draw an inference from the sample to the population, an insightful
description of the data is an important step in drawing conclusions from
it. \textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}

Good descriptive statistics enable us to make sense of the data by
reducing a large set of measurements to a few summary measures that
provide a good, rough picture of the original
measurements.\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}

Summary measure used for a variable depends on its
\underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}.\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}

Our goal will be to describe the variable's
\underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}\textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}
i.e.~the \textbackslash{}\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}

Two major characteristics of the variable's distribution that we often

Numerical Measures of Spread \newpage
The main plots used are \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}

A \underbar{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} is obtained by
splitting the range of the data into equal-sized bins. Then for each
bin, we count the number of points that fall into each bin and that is
the height of our bar (or use relative frequency - i.e.~proportion in
category).\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Typically, an observation equal to a boundary value is put in the higher interval.
\item Bars should touch!
\item Too many classes will spread the data out, thereby not revealing the pattern.  Too few classes will lump the data.  
\item **** This is the most important graphical technique for displaying the distribution of a quantitative variable!

\chapter{Point Estimates}\label{point-estimates}

Learning objectives for this lesson: - How to estimate a mean -
Definition of ``convenience sample'' - Definition of ``systematic
sample'' - Benefits/drawbacks to both approaches - Understand how to
estimate a mean - Understand how to estimate a quantile - Understand
implicit assumptions for these approaches

\section{Estiamte with means}\label{estiamte-with-means}

\subsection{Experiment background}\label{experiment-background-2}

Someone wants to know how much of something they need to satisfy some
population To get a good estimate of this, we can use the average amount
for each one and then multiply by the whole population

\section{Estimate with quantiles}\label{estimate-with-quantiles}

\subsection{Experiment background}\label{experiment-background-3}

Big Deborah's is making new packaging for their cookies. The engineer
responsible for the new desing needs to make sure that the packaging
fits the new cookies. While the cookie manufacturing process is
standardized, there's inevitably some degree of variation in cookie
size. After discussing the issue with corporate, the engineer decides
that a the new cookie sleeves should be large enough to fit 95\% of
cookies that are baked. (The largest five percent will be marketed
separately as ``JUMBO'' cookies.)

\subsection{Define the object of the
experiment}\label{define-the-object-of-the-experiment}

The Engineer is tasked with determining how large the cooke sleeve needs
to be. There's no way for her to know the size of every cookie that Big
Deborah's has made (or will make going forward!), so she'll need to
collect data on existing cookies to inform her cookie sleeve size
determination.

\subsection{Select appropriate response
variables}\label{select-appropriate-response-variables}

If the maximum distance from any one point on the (round) cookie's
perimeter to any other point is smaller than the diameter of the cookie
sleeve, then the cookie will fit. This makes ``cookie diameter'' a good
measure for this test. It is easy to measure for each cookie and is
directly relevant to the experiment's objective.

{[}probably have something in here about {]}

\subsection{IDentify sources of
variation}\label{identify-sources-of-variation}

While the manufacturing process is standardized, there is variation in
size from one cookie to the next. This is one source of variation. The
engineer isn't sure of any others. However, she knows that cookies are
made in multiple factories, and that each factory has multiple ovens.
Ovens and factories could also be sources of variation.

\subsection{Choose an experimental
design}\label{choose-an-experimental-design-2}

The Engineer knows that she needs to look at multiple cookies, since she
knows that there is variation in diameter from one cookie to the next.
One option would be to just use the remaining cookies in the box she has
in her office (22 of the 25-count box remain). {[}something about
convenience sample{]} However, she knows that cookies from the same oven
are typically packaged together. If there is variation from one oven to
the next, looking at the cookies she has in her office may not tell the
whole story.

Instead, she chooses to take every 20th cookie manufactured off the
assembly line until she gets 500 cookies. {[}something about systematic
sample{]}

\subsection{Perform the test}\label{perform-the-test}

The day of the test comes, and the Engineer starts collecting cookies.
However, problems arise! The plan has to shut down half-way through, so
she only gets 431 cookies instead of the 500 she thought she would.
However, she measures the diameters of each cookie and records the data
in a spreadsheet.

\subsection{Statistically analyze the
data}\label{statistically-analyze-the-data-2}

The initial plan had been to rank-order the 500 cookies and estimate the
95th percentile using the diamter of the 475th largets cookie. Since we
didn't get all of our data, we have to improvise. 431 doesn't neatly
yield a value such that exactly 95\% are less than or equal and 5\% are
greater than or equal. One option is to choose the 410th largest cookie
to estimate our percentile. Slightly more than 95\% of cookies will have
smaller diameters than this. Alternatively, we could interpolate between
the 409th and 410th cookies. {[}reasons and logic and math for each of
these{]}

\subsection{Draw conclusions}\label{draw-conclusions-2}

Based on this study, the Engineer concludes that a cookie sleeve large
enough for a cookie of diameter XX will be big enough to contain 95\% of
Big Deborah cookies.

\chapter{Motivating example}\label{motivating-example}

The United States Air Force Academy has 24 sections of Calculus I,
taught by three different types of instructors: In-uniform instructors,
full-time civilian instructors, and visiting faculty. The Dean of
Students wants to give students the best experience possible and make
sure that all three types of instructors are doing a good job. There are
plausible reasons why any one of the three could be doing well:
In-uniform instructors are all members of the Air Force, and students
may be extra attention in these classes because they know that these
instructors rank above them in their chain of command. On the other
hand, full-time instructors have been aroudn the Academy for many years
and understand the Cadets and their workloads. Alternatively, visiting
facutly tend to come from prestigeous institutions and may be familiar
with more recently-developed pedagogical techniques. Regardless, the
Dean wants to understand if there is any variation in end-of-semester
grades of classes taught by these three types of instructors. At the end
of the semester, she collects the average grades from each of the 24
sections. How can she go about investigating this question?

Recall from Chapter 6 that we can use t-tests to compare two group
means. In this case, we'd like to do a comparison across three groups,
and instead of looking at a direct comparison of one group to another,
what the Dean is interested in is whether there's an \emph{overall}
difference across the three groups.

One option might be to just do a bunch of different t-tests. We could
first compare classes taught by in-uniform instructors to classes taught
by full-time civilians, then compare the classes taught by the
in-uniform instructors to the classes taugth by the visiting
instructors, and then finally compare the classes taugth by the
full-time civilains with the classes taught by the visiting facutly.
We'd end up with three p-values, each addressing different questions
than the one we initially set out to answer.

We could do the same thing, except comparing courses taught by one type
of instructor to the combined group of courses taught by the other two,
and this gets a bit closer to the mark. But we're still doing three
tests that individually fail to answer the Dean's question.

What we'd like instead is a single hypothesis that we could test that
direclty gets at the Dean's concern about whether the three types of
instructors were producing end-of-semester grades that were, on average,
the same. {[}Need to make that motivation clearer above.{]}

\chapter{Simple model for the data}\label{simple-model-for-the-data}

some variation from class to class. - write some things in greek,

\chapter{Appendix - Notation}\label{notation}

\section{Standard notation}\label{standard-notation}

Vectors of variables are denoted with Roman letters, such as \(x\) and
\(Y\). Capital letters denote random variables while lower case letters
denote fixed variables. Note that these vectors may be of length 1
depending on context. Bolded values (\textbf{\(x\)}) denote matrices,
and in the case of \textbf{\(Y\)}, possibly single-column matrices.

Unknown parameters are denoted with Greek letters, with boldface font
indicating matrices.

In most models, \(Y\) will denote the univariate response,
\textbf{\(x\)} will describe a matrix of predictor variables, and \(E\)
a vector of random errors. The Greek letter \(\beta\) will be commonly
used for regression parameters (either with subscripts for each values
as in \(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1\) or as a vector (as in \(X\beta\)). The
letters \(i, j, k,\) and \(l\) will be most commonly used as subscripts
or indices. \(N\) will typically denote a sample size (not a random
vector), with subscripted versions (\(n_i\)) describing the number of
observations in a group, and \(p\) describing the number of parameters
in a model beyond the intercept.

We may therefore describe a simple linear regresion model as:

\[Y = x\beta + E\]

In this model, \(Y\) is a \(N\times 1\) random vector, \textbf{\(x\)} is
a \(N\times (p + 1)\) matrix of fixed values, and \(E\) is a
\(N \times 1\) vector.

\(\pi\) is typically used to describe probability parameters, as in
Bernoulli or binomial random variables.

\section{Mixed models}\label{mixed-models}

Still need to add something for this

\section{Effects model
representation}\label{effects-model-representation}

In the effects formulation of ANOVA models, additional greek letters
(\(\alpha\), \(\gamma\), etc.) will appear as parameter effects, as will
\(\mu\), which will typically represent the grand mean. Group-specfic
means will be denoted via subscripts: \(\mu_{ij}\). When using this
representation, it is convenient to describe a single observation as
\(Y_{ijk}\), which is the \(k\)th observation from the group with with
the \(i\)th level of the first factor and the \(j\)th level of the
second factor. In the main effects version of this model, we have:

\[Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \gamma_j + E_{ijk}\]

We can therefore estimate \(\mu_{ij}\) as
\(\hat \mu_{ij} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k = 1}^n Y_{ijk} = \bar{Y}_{ij\cdot}\).
This ``dot'' notation can be extended to any subscript and indicates
summing over the index that has been replaced by the dot. Further note
that the ``hat'' over a paremeter value denotes the estimator for that
parameter value, and the ``bar'' indicates an average. These features
are used generally throughout this book.

\section{Estimators vs.~Estimates}\label{estimators-vs.estimates}

If we want to get pedantic, we can differentiate between estimates and
estimators in our notation. Estimators are functions of random variables
used to estimate parameters. Estimates are realized values of
estimators. To differentiate these, we use Roman letters with hats to
represent estimators (\(\hat B = (x'x )^{-1}x'Y\)) and Greek letters
with hats to represent estimates (\(\hat \beta = 1.52\)).
