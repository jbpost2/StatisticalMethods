# Summarizing Data

A major goal of a study is usually to conduct statistical inference.  Inference can involve determine which variables are important in relation to a response variable and/or predicting a response variable.  To formally do inference we need to define the population of interest as well as **parameters** we want to study.  

- Population - all the values, items, or individuals of interest

- Parameter - a (usually) unknown summary value about the population

Ideally, we'd be able to measure every member of the population and exactly calculate the value of any population parameter.  This would involved conducing a census.  A census is usually not feasible.  Instead we take a subset of the population and try to use these observations to make statements or claims about the population.

- Sample - a subset of the population we observe data on

- Statistic - a summary value calculated from the sample observations

Example - A political scientist surveys 400 people randomly from a list of all registered voters in a particular county.  He asks the people if they plan to vote in the upcoming election and 312 say they do.

**Relate above to definitions...**

To discuss paramters and statistics more easily, symbols are used to denote them.  Luckily, there is a common notation that, for the most, is consistent across statistical literature. 

<!-- Name | Parameter | Statistic | Quantity Measured -->
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Mean | $\mu$     | $\bar{Y}$ or $\bar{y}$ or $\bar{X}$ or $\bar{x}$ | Center or Location -->
<!-- Proportion | $p$ or $\pi$ | $\hat{P}$ or $\hat{p}$ or $\hat{\pi}$ | Location or Frequency -->
<!-- Standard Deviation (SD) | $\sigma$ | $S$ or $s$ | Variability or spread -->
<!-- Variance (Var) | $\sigma^2$ | $S^2$ or $s^2$ | Variability or spread -->

Note: $\bar{Y}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i$ and $S^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2$ where $n$ is the sample size (or number of observed values in the sample).  Sometimes you'll see other notation for proportions **(....... fill in and change table)**

Question of interest will lead you to which parameter you have interest in.  Careful consideration of what your study goals are will also most likely lead you to which type of data you will collect.
