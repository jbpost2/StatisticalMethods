# Summarizing Data

Recall a major goal of conducting a study is often to conduct statistical inference.  Inference can involve determining which variables are important in relation to a response variable and/or predicting a response variable under different scenarios.  To formally do inference we need to define the population of interest as well as **parameters** we want to study.  

- Population - all the values, items, or individuals of interest

- Parameter - a summary measure about a population

Ideally, we'd be able to measure every member of the population and exactly calculate the value of any population parameter.  This would involved conducing a census.  A census is usually not feasible.  Instead we take a subset of the population and try to use these observations to make statements or claims about the population.

- Sample - a subset of the population we observe data on

- Statistic - a summary value calculated from the sample observations

(**A good visual of inference here**)  

Your questions of interest will often lead you to which parameters you have interest in.  Careful consideration of study goals and the time and money you have will also most likely lead you to which type of data you will collect to best make inference on those parameters.  Other times, you must work with existing data that has already been collected.  When this is the case, the data will sometimes guide the parameters you can investigate and ultimately the claims you can make.

## Suggestions for Further Readings  

Exploratory data analysis R book is pretty great.  


## Software  

### R

Recall the general workflow for programming in R.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/RWorkFlow.png")
```

This section is meant to instruct on how to produce common numerical and graphical summaries in R.

```{r, child=c('software/R/03-RNumericalSummaries.Rmd', 'software/R/03-RGraphicalSummariesBase.Rmd', 'software/R/03-RGraphicalSummariesggplot.Rmd')}
```

### SAS  

This section is meant to instruct on how to produce common numerical and graphical summaries in SAS.
